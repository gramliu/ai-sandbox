  "text": "Summary:\n\nThis paper examines the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which encourages large language models (LLMs) to generate step-by-step reasoning to solve complex problems. The key findings are:\n\n1. The validity of the reasoning steps in the CoT demonstrations matters surprisingly little - providing demonstrations with completely invalid reasoning steps only marginally degrades performance compared to standard CoT prompting.\n\n2. The key aspects that determine the effectiveness of CoT prompting are: \n   - Relevance: The bridging objects (e.g. numbers, entities) and language templates used in the rationale should be relevant to the input query.\n   - Coherence: The reasoning steps should be in the correct order, with later steps building on earlier ones.\n\n3. These findings suggest that LLMs may already possess significant multi-step reasoning capabilities from pretraining, and the CoT demonstrations mainly serve to specify an output format that regularizes the model's generation to look step-by-step, rather than teaching new reasoning skills.\n\nKeywords: Chain-of-Thought, large language models, multi-step reasoning, in-context learning\n\nExample Questions:\n\nQ: How does the performance of phi-3-mini compare to state-of-the-art large language models when evaluated on standard academic NLP benchmarks?\nA: Phi-3-mini achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks, despite having only 3.8B parameters. This demonstrates the power of carefully curated training data to enable high quality in compact models.\n\nQ: What techniques were used to ensure phi-3-mini behaves in a safe, robust, and responsible manner during open-ended interactions with humans?\nA: Phi-3-mini underwent an iterative process of safety alignment via finetuning on helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets, red-teaming to identify potential issues, and extensive automated testing across dozens of responsibility and safety harm categories. However, challenges still remain in fully solving safety issues with language models.\n\nQ: How might the ability to run highly capable language models like phi-3-mini directly on consumer devices change the way AI assistants are developed and deployed in the future?\n(No answer provided)\n\nQ: What are some potential beneficial applications of a model like phi-3-mini that can perform advanced language tasks while preserving user privacy by running fully on-device?\nA: Some potential applications include: 1) Privacy-preserving mobile AI assistants that can engage in open-ended dialogue and help with tasks like writing and analysis without sending user data to the cloud. 2) Embedded NLP systems for domains like healthcare where privacy is critical. 3) Democratization of advanced language AI capabilities to developers/researchers without access to massive computing resources.",

    "abstract": "  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can dramatically improve the multi-step\nreasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). CoT explicitly encourages\nthe LLM to generate intermediate rationales for solving a problem, by providing\na series of reasoning steps in the demonstrations. Despite its success, there\nis still little understanding of what makes CoT prompting effective and which\naspects of the demonstrated reasoning steps contribute to its performance. In\nthis paper, we show that CoT reasoning is possible even with invalid\ndemonstrations - prompting with invalid reasoning steps can achieve over 80-90%\nof the performance obtained using CoT under various metrics, while still\ngenerating coherent lines of reasoning during inference. Further experiments\nshow that other aspects of the rationales, such as being relevant to the query\nand correctly ordering the reasoning steps, are much more important for\neffective CoT reasoning. Overall, these findings both deepen our understanding\nof CoT prompting, and open up new questions regarding LLMs' capability to learn\nto reason in context.\n",
