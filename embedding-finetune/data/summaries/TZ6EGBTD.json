  "text": "Summary:\n\nThis technical report introduces the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model, a novel architecture that combines the efficient parallelizable training of Transformers with the efficient inference of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RWKV is able to scale to models with tens of billions of parameters while maintaining linear computational complexity during both training and inference, making it a promising alternative to Transformers for sequence processing tasks.\n\nKeywords: compact language models, filtered training data, on-device inference, model scaling, responsible AI\n\nExample Questions:\n\nQ: How does the performance of phi-3-mini compare to state-of-the-art large language models when evaluated on standard academic NLP benchmarks?\nA: Phi-3-mini achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks, despite having only 3.8B parameters. This demonstrates the power of carefully curated training data to enable high quality in compact models.\n\nQ: What techniques were used to ensure phi-3-mini behaves in a safe, robust, and responsible manner during open-ended interactions with humans?\nA: The phi-3-mini model underwent an iterative process of safety alignment via finetuning on helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets, red-teaming to identify potential issues, and extensive automated testing across dozens of responsibility and safety harm categories. However, challenges still remain in fully solving safety issues with language models that will require further research and development.",

    "abstract": "  Transformers have revolutionized almost all natural language processing (NLP)\ntasks but suffer from memory and computational complexity that scales\nquadratically with sequence length. In contrast, recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but\nstruggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in\nparallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture,\nReceptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient\nparallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs.\n  Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to\nformulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing\ncomputations during training and maintains constant computational and memory\ncomplexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion\nparameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs\non par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage\nthis architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a\nsignificant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational\nefficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n",
