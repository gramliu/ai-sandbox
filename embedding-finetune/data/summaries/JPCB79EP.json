    "abstract": "  Large language models (LLM) have become a critical component in many\napplications of machine learning. However, standard approaches to training LLM\nrequire a large number of tightly interconnected accelerators, with devices\nexchanging gradients and other intermediate states at each optimization step.\nWhile it is difficult to build and maintain a single computing cluster hosting\nmany accelerators, it might be easier to find several computing clusters each\nhosting a smaller number of devices. In this work, we propose a distributed\noptimization algorithm, Distributed Low-Communication (DiLoCo), that enables\ntraining of language models on islands of devices that are poorly connected.\nThe approach is a variant of federated averaging, where the number of inner\nsteps is large, the inner optimizer is AdamW, and the outer optimizer is\nNesterov momentum. On the widely used C4 dataset, we show that DiLoCo on 8\nworkers performs as well as fully synchronous optimization while communicating\n500 times less. DiLoCo exhibits great robustness to the data distribution of\neach worker. It is also robust to resources becoming unavailable over time, and\nvice versa, it can seamlessly leverage resources that become available during\ntraining.\n",
