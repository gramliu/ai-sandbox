  "text": "Summary:\n\nThis paper examines the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which encourages large language models (LLMs) to generate step-by-step reasoning to solve complex problems. The key findings are:\n\n1. The validity of the reasoning steps in the CoT demonstrations matters surprisingly little - providing demonstrations with completely invalid reasoning steps only marginally degrades performance compared to standard CoT prompting.\n\n2. The key aspects that determine the effectiveness of CoT prompting are: 1) the relevance of the bridging objects (numbers, entities) and language templates to the input query, and 2) the coherence of the reasoning steps.\n\n3. LLMs seem to already possess significant multi-step reasoning capabilities from pretraining, and the CoT demonstrations mainly serve to specify an output format that regularizes the model to generate relevant and coherent rationales, rather than teaching new reasoning skills.\n\nKeywords: Chain-of-Thought, large language models, in-context learning, multi-step reasoning\n\nExample Questions:\n\nQ: How does the performance of a language model using CoT prompting with invalid reasoning steps compare to standard CoT prompting?\nA: Providing demonstrations with invalid reasoning steps only marginally degrades the language model's performance, suggesting the validity of the reasoning is not a key factor for the effectiveness of CoT prompting.\n\nQ: What are the most important aspects of the CoT demonstrations that determine the model's reasoning ability?\nA: The relevance of the bridging objects and language templates to the input query, as well as the coherence of the reasoning steps, are the key factors that determine the effectiveness of CoT prompting, rather than the validity of the reasoning.\n\nQ: How might these findings about the role of CoT demonstrations impact the way we evaluate and benchmark language models' reasoning capabilities? \n(no_answer)",

    "abstract": "  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can dramatically improve the multi-step\nreasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). CoT explicitly encourages\nthe LLM to generate intermediate rationales for solving a problem, by providing\na series of reasoning steps in the demonstrations. Despite its success, there\nis still little understanding of what makes CoT prompting effective and which\naspects of the demonstrated reasoning steps contribute to its performance. In\nthis paper, we show that CoT reasoning is possible even with invalid\ndemonstrations - prompting with invalid reasoning steps can achieve over 80-90%\nof the performance obtained using CoT under various metrics, while still\ngenerating coherent lines of reasoning during inference. Further experiments\nshow that other aspects of the rationales, such as being relevant to the query\nand correctly ordering the reasoning steps, are much more important for\neffective CoT reasoning. Overall, these findings both deepen our understanding\nof CoT prompting, and open up new questions regarding LLMs' capability to learn\nto reason in context.\n",
