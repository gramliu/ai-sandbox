  "input": "<metadata>\n{\n  \"title\": \"One Embedder, Any Task: Instruction-Finetuned Text Embeddings\",\n  \"abstract\": \"  We introduce INSTRUCTOR, a new method for computing text embeddings given\\ntask instructions: every text input is embedded together with instructions\\nexplaining the use case (e.g., task and domain descriptions). Unlike encoders\\nfrom prior work that are more specialized, INSTRUCTOR is a single embedder that\\ncan generate text embeddings tailored to different downstream tasks and\\ndomains, without any further training. We first annotate instructions for 330\\ndiverse tasks and train INSTRUCTOR on this multitask mixture with a contrastive\\nloss. We evaluate INSTRUCTOR on 70 embedding evaluation tasks (66 of which are\\nunseen during training), ranging from classification and information retrieval\\nto semantic textual similarity and text generation evaluation. INSTRUCTOR,\\nwhile having an order of magnitude fewer parameters than the previous best\\nmodel, achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average improvement of\\n3.4% compared to the previous best results on the 70 diverse datasets.

This is in contrast to prior embedding models that are more specialized.\n\nKey Findings:\n- INSTRUCTOR is trained on a new dataset called MEDI, which contains 330 diverse text embedding datasets annotated with human-written task instructions.\n- INSTRUCTOR outperforms prior state-of-the-art embedding models by an average of 3.4% on 70 diverse evaluation datasets spanning classification, semantic textual similarity, information retrieval, text generation evaluation, and prompt retrieval.\n- The instruction-based finetuning enables INSTRUCTOR to benefit from diverse training data, whereas models trained without instructions struggle when faced with a mix of symmetric and asymmetric tasks.\n- INSTRUCTOR demonstrates robustness to paraphrased instructions, especially when trained on the diverse Super-NI datasets.\n- Scaling up the model size leads to greater performance gains for INSTRUCTOR compared to the base GTR model, suggesting instructions require additional model capacity.\n\nKeywords: text embeddings, instruction-based finetuning, multitask learning, zero-shot transfer\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does INSTRUCTOR's performance compare to prior state-of-the-art embedding models on a wide range of downstream tasks?\nA: INSTRUCTOR outperforms the previous best model, Sent-T5-XXL, by an average of 3.4% across 70 diverse evaluation datasets, despite having an order of magnitude fewer parameters.\n\nQ: What is the key innovation in INSTRUCTOR's training approach that enables it to perform well on such a wide variety of tasks?\nA: The key innovation is INSTRUCTOR's use of natural language instructions describing the task and domain, which are provided along with the text input during training. This instruction-based finetuning allows INSTRUCTOR to benefit from diverse training data and generalize better to unseen tasks.\n\nQ: How does INSTRUCTOR's performance scale with model size compared to the base GTR model? What does this suggest about the role of model capacity for instruction-based embeddings?\nA: INSTRUCTOR sees greater performance gains from scaling up the model size compared to the base GTR model. This suggests that instructions require additional model capacity to be effectively encoded, beyond what is needed for standard text embeddings.\n\nQ: How does INSTRUCTOR's robustness to paraphrased instructions compare to prior instruction-finetuned models? What dataset design choices contributed to this improved robustness?\nA: INSTRUCTOR demonstrates significantly improved robustness to paraphrased instructions compared to prior work. This is attributed to the diverse task definitions in the Super-NI datasets used for training, which helped the model handle a wider range of instruction styles and formats.</text>",
  "output": "Today I worked on exploring the new INSTRUCTOR text embedding model from OpenAI. This model is really exciting because it allows you to generate embeddings tailored for specific tasks and domains just by providing natural language instructions along with the text input.\n\nIn the morning, I read through the paper and set up the code to run some examples. I was impressed by how easy it was to get started - you just need to install the Python package and provide the text and instruction as arguments. I tried it out on a few different tasks like text classification, semantic similarity, and question answering just by changing the instruction string.\n\nAfter lunch, I spent some time analyzing the embeddings on one of my own datasets for email intent classification. I compared INSTRUCTOR to some of the other popular embedding models I've used before. The results were really promising - INSTRUCTOR outperformed the baselines by 2-3% even though I was just using the pretrained model without any fine-tuning. I could definitely see an improvement in how well the embeddings captured the subtle semantic differences between intents.\n\nIn the afternoon, I explored the code a bit more to understand how I could fine-tune INSTRUCTOR on my own data if needed. The process seems pretty straightforward - you just need to provide examples of text inputs annotated with the relevant instructions. I put together a small dataset to test this out.\n\nOverall, I'm really excited about the potential of INSTRUCTOR. Having a single embedding model that can adapt to any task just by specifying instructions in natural language is a game-changer. I can already think of so many applications where this flexibility would be valuable. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on any updates or new releases from OpenAI related to this work."
