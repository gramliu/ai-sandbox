This involves providing the model with a few examples of input-chain of thought-output triples during prompting.\n- Experiments show that chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks, especially for large language models of 100B+ parameters. This reasoning ability emerges as the model scale increases.\n- With chain-of-thought prompting, the 540B parameter PaLM model achieves new state-of-the-art results on several math word problem benchmarks, outperforming even finetuned models.\n- Chain-of-thought prompting also improves performance on commonsense reasoning tasks like CSQA and StrategyQA, and enables length generalization on symbolic manipulation tasks.\n- The paper provides analysis showing that the generated chains of thought are mostly coherent and logically correct, though factual errors can still occur.\n\nKeywords:\n- Chain-of-thought prompting\n- Multi-step reasoning\n- Large language models\n- Arithmetic reasoning\n- Commonsense reasoning\n- Symbolic reasoning\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does the performance of phi-3-mini compare to state-of-the-art large language models when evaluated on standard academic NLP benchmarks?\nA: Phi-3-mini achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks, despite having only 3.8B parameters. This demonstrates the power of carefully curated training data to enable high quality in compact models.\n\nQ: What techniques were used to ensure phi-3-mini behaves in a safe, robust, and responsible manner during open-ended interactions with humans?\nA: The phi-3-mini model underwent an iterative process of safety alignment via finetuning on helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets, red-teaming to identify potential issues, and extensive automated testing across dozens of responsibility and safety harm categories. However, challenges still remain in fully solving safety issues with language models.\n\nQ: How might the ability to run highly capable language models like phi-3-mini directly on consumer devices change the way AI assistants are developed and deployed in the future?\n(No definitive answer provided in the paper)\n\nQ: What are some potential beneficial applications of a model like phi-3-mini that can perform advanced language tasks while preserving user privacy by running fully on-device?\nA: Some potential applications include: 1) Privacy-preserving mobile AI assistants, 2) Embedded NLP systems for domains like healthcare where privacy is critical, 3) Democratization of advanced language AI capabilities to developers/researchers without access to massive computing resources.</text>",
