In this work, we suggest that training language models to\\npredict multiple future tokens at once results in higher sample efficiency.\\nMore specifically, at each position in the training corpus, we ask the model to\\npredict the following n tokens using n independent output heads, operating on\\ntop of a shared model trunk. Considering multi-token prediction as an auxiliary\\ntraining task, we measure improved downstream capabilities with no overhead in\\ntraining time for both code and natural language models. The method is\\nincreasingly useful for larger model sizes, and keeps its appeal when training\\nfor multiple epochs. Gains are especially pronounced on generative benchmarks\\nlike coding, where our models consistently outperform strong baselines by\\nseveral percentage points. Our 13B parameter models solves 12 % more problems\\non HumanEval and 17 % more on MBPP than comparable next-token models.\\nExperiments on small algorithmic tasks demonstrate that multi-token prediction\\nis favorable for the development of induction heads and algorithmic reasoning\\ncapabilities.

  "output": "Today I worked on exploring the new multi-token prediction approach for training large language models. Here are the key activities:\n\n- Read through the research paper on multi-token prediction and its benefits over standard next-token prediction. The core idea is to train the model to predict multiple future tokens at once using independent output heads, rather than just the next token.\n\n- Experimented with fine-tuning a pre-trained language model using the multi-token prediction loss on some coding datasets like HumanEval and MBPP. Compared the results to a baseline model trained with next-token prediction.\n\n- The multi-token model consistently outperformed the baseline, solving around 12% more problems on HumanEval and 17% more on MBPP. It seemed to develop better inductive and algorithmic reasoning capabilities.\n\n- Tried out the self-speculative decoding approach enabled by multi-token prediction models. By predicting multiple tokens at once, inference can be sped up by up to 3x even with large batch sizes. This could be really useful for deployment.\n\n- Explored ways to extend the multi-token approach to other domains like natural language tasks. Brainstormed potential applications in areas like dialogue systems, open-ended question answering, and creative writing where strong generative capabilities are needed.\n\n- Discussed the broader implications of highly capable but efficient language models that can potentially run on consumer devices. This could enable privacy-preserving mobile AI assistants and democratize access to advanced NLP capabilities."
