However, in other ways, LLMs are a\\nstep backward from traditional special-purpose NLP models; they require\\nextensive computational resources for deployment and can be gated behind APIs.\\nIn this paper, we propose Prompt2Model, a general-purpose method that takes a\\nnatural language task description like the prompts provided to LLMs, and uses\\nit to train a special-purpose model that is conducive to deployment. This is\\ndone through a multi-step process of retrieval of existing datasets and\\npretrained models, dataset generation using LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning on\\nthese retrieved and generated datasets. Over three tasks, we demonstrate that\\ngiven the same few-shot prompt as input, Prompt2Model trains models that\\noutperform the results of a strong LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo, by an average of 20%\\nwhile being up to 700 times smaller. We also show that this data can be used to\\nobtain reliable performance estimates of model performance, enabling model\\ndevelopers to assess model reliability before deployment.

This combination was found to be more effective than using either retrieved or generated data alone.\n\nQ: Can the synthetic evaluation data generated by Prompt2Model reliably identify real performance improvements across different model candidates?\nA: Yes, the paper shows that the synthetic evaluation data generated by Prompt2Model was able to reliably rank different model candidates in the same order as the real benchmark datasets.</text>",
  "output": "Today I worked on exploring the new Prompt2Model framework from OpenAI. This allows me to generate deployable models from natural language instructions, which is really exciting!\n\nFirst, I spent some time reading through the documentation and examples to understand how Prompt2Model works. The key steps are:\n\n1. Provide a natural language prompt describing the task I want a model for, like \"Classify movie reviews as positive or negative.\"\n\n2. Prompt2Model retrieves relevant datasets and pre-trained models, then uses a large language model to generate synthetic training data based on the prompt.\n\n3. It fine-tunes a smaller model on the combined real and synthetic data to create a deployable model for the specified task.\n\nAfter getting familiar with the process, I decided to try generating a model for sentiment analysis on product reviews. I wrote a prompt describing the task and provided a few examples, then let Prompt2Model handle the rest.\n\nIt took a little while for the retrieval, generation, and fine-tuning steps to complete. But once done, I had a lightweight model that performed really well on the test set! The accuracy was even better than the original large language model used by Prompt2Model.\n\nI'm really impressed by how this allows me to quickly create custom models for niche tasks, without the overhead of managing huge language models. I can definitely see Prompt2Model being a powerful tool for prototyping and productionizing NLP systems. I'm looking forward to experimenting with it more on other tasks."
