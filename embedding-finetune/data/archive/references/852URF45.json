However, current agents\\nare primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading\\nto a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an\\nenvironment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and\\nreproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web,\\nand create an environment with fully functional websites from four common\\ndomains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software\\ndevelopment, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools\\n(e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage\\nhuman-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of\\nbenchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task\\ncompletions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed\\nto emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment\\nwith several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning\\nbefore acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is\\nchallenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task\\nsuccess rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of\\n78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust\\nagents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from\\nperfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to\\nmeasure such progress.\\n\",\n  \"published\": \"2023-07-25T22:59:32Z\"\n}\n</metadata>\n<text>\nSummary:\n\nThe paper introduces WebArena, a realistic and reproducible web environment for building and evaluating autonomous agents. Key points:\n\n- WebArena comprises fully functional websites across 4 common web domains (e-commerce, forums, software development, content management) with organic data, as well as utility tools and knowledge resources.\n\n- The environment is designed to be standalone and self-hostable, enabling fair and consistent evaluation across different systems.\n\n- The authors release a benchmark of 812 diverse, long-horizon web-based tasks, focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions rather than just textual action sequences.\n\n- Experiments with state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 show they struggle, achieving only 14.41% end-to-end task success rate compared to 78.24% human performance. This highlights the need for further advancements in areas like active exploration, failure recovery, and reasoning.\n\n- WebArena provides a realistic testbed to drive progress in building robust and effective autonomous agents that can handle complex, real-world web-based tasks.\n\nKeywords: web environment, autonomous agents, benchmark, functional correctness, language models\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does WebArena differ from previous environments for evaluating agents that perform web-based tasks?\nA: WebArena is designed to be highly realistic and reproducible, with fully functional websites from common web domains and organic data, unlike previous environments that often oversimplify real-world complexities.\n\nQ: What are some of the key capabilities that current state-of-the-art language models lack in order to perform well on the tasks in the WebArena benchmark?\nA: The results suggest current models struggle with active exploration, failure recovery, and reasoning required to successfully complete the diverse, long-horizon tasks in WebArena, highlighting the need for further advancements in these areas.\n\nQ: How does WebArena's approach to evaluating task completion differ from prior work, and why is this important?\nA: WebArena focuses on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions, rather than just comparing textual action sequences. This allows accommodating multiple valid paths to achieve the same goal, which is crucial for complex, real-world tasks.\n\nQ: How could WebArena be used to drive progress in building robust and effective autonomous agents for web-based tasks?

  "output": "Today I spent time exploring the WebArena environment, which is designed to build and test autonomous agents for performing web-based tasks. I started by setting up the environment locally, which involved downloading and configuring the various websites and tools included.\n\nFirst, I familiarized myself with the e-commerce website by browsing product categories, adding items to my cart, and going through the checkout process. I noticed the website had realistic features like user reviews, recommendations, and multiple shipping options. I then moved on to the social forum, where I read through some discussions on programming topics and tried posting a new question.\n\nNext up was the collaborative software development platform. I cloned a sample project repository, made some code changes, and submitted a pull request. The environment even included integrations with common tools like continuous integration and code review. Finally, I played around with the content management system, creating new pages and blog posts with rich formatting.\n\nThroughout my exploration, I relied heavily on the provided tools like the map for navigating between websites and the user manuals for looking up instructions. I quickly realized how challenging it would be for an autonomous agent to complete complex, multi-step tasks across these websites without getting stuck or making mistakes.\n\nTo get a better sense of the types of tasks agents are evaluated on, I attempted a few from the benchmark. One task involved researching a coding issue on the forum, applying a suggested fix to the project codebase, and documenting the solution in a wiki page. Despite following the steps carefully, I made a small mistake that caused the task to fail its functional tests.\n\nOverall, my experience with WebArena drove home how remarkably complex and open-ended these web-based tasks are, requiring capabilities like active exploration, robust error handling, and pragmatic reasoning that current AI systems still struggle with. I'm excited to continue experimenting with WebArena as it provides a powerful environment for pushing the boundaries of autonomous agents."
