Although conventional models including\\nRNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long\\ndependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or\\nmore steps.

The key innovations are:\n\n1. A new parameterization of the SSM that decomposes the state matrix A into a normal and low-rank component, allowing for efficient computation of the SSM's recurrent and convolutional representations.\n\n2. Algorithms that leverage this parameterization to compute the SSM representations in near-linear time and space complexity, in contrast to previous SSM-based models that had prohibitive computational requirements.\n\nThe S4 model achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of benchmarks:\n\n- On the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark for long-range dependencies, S4 substantially outperforms all previous models, including solving the challenging Path-X task that no prior model could solve.\n\n- On raw speech classification with very long sequences, S4 halves the error rate of specialized speech CNN models.\n\n- S4 is competitive with state-of-the-art autoregressive models on large-scale generative tasks like CIFAR-10 density estimation and WikiText-103 language modeling, while being much faster at generation.\n\n- S4 can be applied with minimal modifications to a variety of other sequence modeling tasks, including sequential image classification, time series forecasting, and adapting to changes in sampling rate, outperforming specialized models in many cases.\n\nThe authors argue that the SSM framework, when properly parameterized and computed as in S4, has the potential to serve as a general-purpose sequence modeling solution that can handle a wide range of data modalities and tasks.\n\nKeywords: state space models, long-range dependencies, efficient sequence modeling\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does the S4 model's parameterization and algorithms allow it to compute the SSM representations much more efficiently than previous SSM-based models?\nA: The key innovations are: 1) Decomposing the state matrix A into a normal and low-rank component, allowing it to be diagonalized stably. 2) Computing the SSM's generating function in the frequency domain and leveraging the Woodbury identity and Cauchy kernel computations to reduce the complexity.\n\nQ: What are some of the key capabilities of the S4 model that allow it to perform well on a diverse range of sequence modeling tasks?\nA: S4 can: 1) Handle long-range dependencies very effectively, solving challenging benchmarks like Path-X that no prior model could. 2) Match the performance of specialized models on tasks like speech classification and time series forecasting. 3) Be competitive with state-of-the-art autoregressive models on large-scale generative tasks while being much faster at generation. 4) Adapt to changes in sampling rate without retraining.\n\nQ: How does the S4 model's general-purpose nature and ability to handle a wide range of sequence modeling tasks compare to more specialized models like Transformers?\nA: The authors argue that the SSM framework underlying S4, when properly parameterized and computed, has the potential to serve as a more general-purpose sequence modeling solution compared to models like Transformers that still require substantial specialization per task to achieve high performance. S4 can be applied with minimal modifications across a diverse set of benchmarks.</text>",
