To fill\\nthe gap, we present an end-to-end general-purpose any-to-any MM-LLM system,\\nNExT-GPT. We connect an LLM with multimodal adaptors and different diffusion\\ndecoders, enabling NExT-GPT to perceive inputs and generate outputs in\\narbitrary combinations of text, images, videos, and audio. By leveraging the\\nexisting well-trained highly-performing encoders and decoders, NExT-GPT is\\ntuned with only a small amount of parameter (1%) of certain projection layers,\\nwhich not only benefits low-cost training and also facilitates convenient\\nexpansion to more potential modalities. Moreover, we introduce a\\nmodality-switching instruction tuning (MosIT) and manually curate a\\nhigh-quality dataset for MosIT, based on which NExT-GPT is empowered with\\ncomplex cross-modal semantic understanding and content generation. Overall, our\\nresearch showcases the promising possibility of building an AI agent capable of\\nmodeling universal modalities, paving the way for more human-like AI research\\nin the community.

  "output": "Today I spent some time exploring the exciting new NExT-GPT model for any-to-any multimodal generation. In the morning, I started by reviewing the key ideas behind NExT-GPT - how it connects a large language model with multimodal adaptors and diffusion decoders to enable perceiving inputs and generating outputs across text, images, videos, and audio in arbitrary combinations.\n\nAfter lunch, I decided to try out the model myself. I first gathered some sample data including text descriptions, images, and short video clips related to my latest coding project. I then used the NExT-GPT demo interface to input this multimodal data and generate new text, image, and video content based on my inputs. It was really cool to see the model understand the semantics across modalities and produce coherent multimodal outputs!\n\nIn the evening, I spent some time reading through the modality-switching instruction tuning (MosIT) dataset that was used to train NExT-GPT's cross-modal capabilities. The dataset contains multi-turn dialogues with diverse modality combinations and switches, which seems to be key for the model's strong cross-modal understanding. I'm really excited about the potential of models like NExT-GPT to enable more natural multimodal human-AI interaction.\n\nTo try out some coding related to this, I explored ways to interface with the NExT-GPT model's API from Python. I wrote a script to send multimodal inputs to the API and process the generated outputs. I also looked into techniques for fine-tuning the model on domain-specific data for applications like multimodal documentation generation or creative media synthesis. Overall, it was a fascinating day diving into the cutting-edge world of any-to-any multimodal AI!"
