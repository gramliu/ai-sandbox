The key steps are:\n\n1. Generate a baseline response to the query using the language model.\n2. Plan a set of verification questions to check the factual claims in the baseline response. \n3. Execute the verification by independently answering the planned questions.\n4. Generate a final verified response that incorporates the results of the verification.\n\nThe authors explore different variants of the verification execution step, including joint, 2-step, and factored approaches. The factored approach, where the verification questions are answered independently without conditioning on the original response, is found to perform the best.\n\nThe paper evaluates CoVe on a variety of tasks - list-based questions from Wikidata, closed-book MultiSpanQA, and longform biography generation. Across these tasks, CoVe is shown to significantly reduce hallucinations compared to the baseline language model, while maintaining or improving overall performance.\n\nKey findings:\n\n- CoVe improves precision on list-based tasks by reducing the number of hallucinated answers.\n- CoVe improves performance on closed-book QA, increasing F1 by 23% over the baseline.\n- On longform biography generation, CoVe improves the FACTSCORE metric by 28% compared to the baseline.\n- The factored and 2-step variants of CoVe outperform the joint approach, as they avoid repeating hallucinations from the original response.\n- Explicit reasoning steps in the \"factor+revise\" variant further improve performance by detecting and removing inconsistencies.\n- CoVe-based Llama 65B outperforms other large models like InstructGPT, ChatGPT and PerplexityAI on the biography generation task.\n\nThe paper also finds that language models can often answer short verification questions more accurately than they can generate the full longform response, suggesting an opportunity for targeted deliberation.\n\nExample Questions:\n\nQ: How does the performance of phi-3-mini compare to state-of-the-art large language models when evaluated on standard academic NLP benchmarks?\nA: Phi-3-mini achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks, achieving 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench despite having only 3.8B parameters.\n\nQ: What techniques were used to ensure phi-3-mini behaves in a safe, robust, and responsible manner during open-ended interactions with humans?\nA: The phi-3-mini model underwent an iterative process of safety alignment via finetuning on helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets, red-teaming to identify potential issues, and extensive automated testing across dozens of responsibility and safety harm categories.\n\nQ: How might the ability to run highly capable language models like phi-3-mini directly on consumer devices change the way AI assistants are developed and deployed in the future?\nA: Some potential applications include privacy-preserving mobile AI assistants, embedded NLP systems for domains like healthcare where privacy is critical, and democratization of advanced language AI capabilities to developers/researchers without access to massive computing resources.</text>",
