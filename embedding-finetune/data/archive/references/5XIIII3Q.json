The key innovations are:\n\n1. Recursive clustering and summarization of text chunks to build a multi-layered tree, capturing both high-level themes and granular details.\n2. Two querying strategies - tree traversal and collapsed tree - that leverage this tree structure to retrieve relevant context for downstream tasks.\n\nExperiments show that RAPTOR consistently outperforms traditional retrieval methods like BM25 and DPR across several question-answering datasets that require understanding long-form documents:\n\n- On the QASPER dataset, RAPTOR achieves state-of-the-art F1 scores when coupled with GPT-4.\n- On the QuALITY dataset, RAPTOR with GPT-4 sets a new benchmark, outperforming previous best results by a large margin.\n- On the NarrativeQA dataset, RAPTOR with UnifiedQA achieves the best METEOR score.\n\nThe paper also provides a detailed analysis of RAPTOR's scalability, the contribution of different tree layers, and the quality of the summarizations.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n- RAPTOR's hierarchical tree structure allows it to retrieve relevant information at the appropriate level of granularity for a given query.\n- Recursive summarization and clustering are crucial components that enable RAPTOR to outperform traditional retrieval methods.\n- RAPTOR scales linearly in terms of both token expenditure and build time, making it computationally efficient for large corpora.\n\nPotential Questions:\nQ: How does RAPTOR's tree-based retrieval approach differ from traditional passage retrieval methods, and what are the key advantages?\nQ: What role do the different layers of the RAPTOR tree play in answering questions that require understanding the overall narrative versus focusing on specific details?\nQ: How does RAPTOR's performance compare to other state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented language models on tasks that involve complex, multi-step reasoning over long documents?\nQ: What are some potential applications or use cases where a compact yet highly capable language model like phi-3-mini could be beneficial?</text>",
  "output": "Today I worked on implementing the RAPTOR model for hierarchical text retrieval and summarization. In the morning, I started by studying the research paper and understanding the key ideas behind recursive text clustering and summarization to build a tree-structured representation.\n\nAfter lunch, I began coding up the recursive text chunking and embedding module. I used the Sentence Transformers library to generate semantic embeddings for text chunks, and then applied agglomerative clustering to group similar chunks together. For each cluster, I generated a summary representation by taking the centroid of the chunk embeddings.\n\nIn the late afternoon, I implemented the tree construction algorithm that recursively clusters and summarizes the text chunks from the bottom up. I also coded up the two retrieval strategies mentioned in the paper - tree traversal and collapsed tree retrieval. For the collapsed tree, I precomputed summary embeddings at each level by averaging the child summaries.\n\nTo test my implementation, I used a subset of the Wikipedia corpus and built a RAPTOR tree for a few long articles. I wrote some functions to query the tree with natural language questions and visualize the retrieved summaries and supporting details at different granularity levels.\n\nThe initial results looked promising - RAPTOR could effectively zoom in to the relevant sections of long articles and provide summaries at multiple levels of detail. However, I noticed that the quality of the extracted summaries was heavily dependent on the underlying clustering algorithm. I spent some time fine-tuning the clustering hyperparameters in the evening.\n\nOverall, it was a productive day spent understanding and implementing this novel retrieval technique. Tomorrow, I plan to integrate RAPTOR with a language model like GPT-4 and evaluate its performance on question-answering benchmarks like QuALITY and NarrativeQA."
