In particular: (1) A wider range of tasks now\\nface an increasing risk of containing factual errors when handled by generative\\nmodels. (2) Generated texts tend to be lengthy and lack a clearly defined\\ngranularity for individual facts. (3) There is a scarcity of explicit evidence\\navailable during the process of fact checking. With the above challenges in\\nmind, in this paper, we propose FacTool, a task and domain agnostic framework\\nfor detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g.,\\nChatGPT). Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, code\\ngeneration, mathematical reasoning, and scientific literature review) show the\\nefficacy of the proposed method. We release the code of FacTool associated with\\nChatGPT plugin interface at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool .\\n\",\n  \"published\": \"2023-07-25T14:20:51Z\"\n}\n</metadata>\n<text>\nHere is a summary of the key points from the paper:\n\nKey Findings and Highlights:\n- The paper introduces FacTool, a task and domain agnostic framework for detecting factual errors in text generated by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.\n- FacTool leverages various tools like search engines, code interpreters, and LLMs themselves to gather evidence about the factuality of generated content.\n- Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, code generation, math problem solving, and scientific literature review) show the effectiveness of the FacTool framework.\n- FacTool powered by GPT-4 outperforms self-check baselines and FacTool powered by ChatGPT across the evaluated scenarios.\n- FacTool can significantly outperform self-check models, especially in more challenging domains like scientific literature review.\n\nKeywords:\n- Factuality detection\n- Large language models\n- Tool-augmented framework\n- Multi-task and multi-domain scenarios\n- Knowledge-based QA, code generation, math problem solving, scientific literature review\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does FacTool leverage different tools to assess the factuality of generated content across diverse tasks?\nA: FacTool uses a 5-step process that involves claim extraction, query generation, tool querying, evidence collection, and verification. It utilizes tools like search engines, code interpreters, and LLMs themselves to gather relevant evidence for evaluating the factuality of the generated text.\n\nQ: What are the key advantages of FacTool compared to prior work on factuality detection?\nA: Key advantages include: 1) FacTool's task and domain agnostic design, allowing it to be applied across a wide range of scenarios, 2) FacTool's ability to handle lengthy generated text without explicit claims, and 3) FacTool's use of tool-augmentation to overcome the limitations of relying solely on LLM reasoning.\n\nQ: How can the FacTool framework be used to audit the factuality of responses generated by modern chatbots like GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Vicuna?\nA: The paper demonstrates using FacTool powered by GPT-4 to evaluate the factual accuracy of responses generated by various chatbots across knowledge-based QA, code generation, math problem solving, and scientific literature review tasks. The results show GPT-4 has the best factuality, while supervised fine-tuned chatbots like Vicuna perform reasonably well in common scenarios but struggle more in challenging domains.</text>",
  "output": "Today I worked on developing a tool called FacTool to help detect factual errors in text generated by AI language models like ChatGPT. The key steps involved:\n\n1. I started by extracting specific claims or statements from the generated text that need to be fact-checked.\n\n2. For each claim, I generated relevant search queries to find supporting evidence from sources like search engines, code interpreters, and other language models.\n\n3. I used these tools to gather information and evidence related to the factual accuracy of the claims.\n\n4. Finally, I analyzed all the collected evidence to verify whether each claim is factual, partially factual, or non-factual.\n\nThroughout the day, I tested FacTool on various tasks like knowledge-based question answering, code generation, math problem solving, and reviewing scientific literature. The results showed that FacTool powered by GPT-4 can significantly improve factuality detection compared to just relying on the language model itself.\n\nI'm really excited about the potential of FacTool to help audit and improve the factual reliability of AI-generated text across different domains. It was challenging but rewarding to develop a system that can leverage multiple tools and sources of evidence for this critical task."
