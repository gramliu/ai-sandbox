  "note": "Today I worked on exploring a new approach to representation learning called \"Internet Explorer\". The key idea is to dynamically search the open web for relevant images to train a model for a specific target dataset, rather than relying on static, pre-curated datasets.\n\nIn the morning, I set up the Internet Explorer codebase and read through the paper to understand the main components:\n\n1. A search agent that cycles between querying the web for images, training a self-supervised model on the downloaded data, and updating its search strategy based on what images were useful.\n\n2. Using text-based search queries combined with GPT-generated descriptors to efficiently explore a wide range of visual concepts on the web.\n\n3. A Gaussian process model to estimate the relevance of unseen concepts and prioritize promising search terms.\n\nAfter lunch, I ran some initial experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset. I defined a set of seed search terms related to the classes, and let Internet Explorer run for a few hours, actively searching, downloading, and training on relevant web images.\n\nIt was really cool to see the model's performance improve over time as it discovered more useful visual concepts and examples from the open web. Even with just a few hours of searching and a single GPU, it was able to match the accuracy of the CLIP baseline by the end.\n\nIn the evening, I set up a longer run on the ImageNet dataset to let it search overnight. I'm excited to analyze the results tomorrow and see what kind of performance gains are possible with more compute. The idea of tapping into the open web as a virtually unlimited source of training data is really powerful.",
