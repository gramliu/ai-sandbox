  "note": "ately, the provided summary does not seem to be related to the paper titled \"Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation\". The summary appears to be discussing a different language model called \"phi-3-mini\" and its performance on academic benchmarks, safety, and robustness. It does not cover the key points about the Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG) method described in the abstract. I cannot provide a relevant coding activity summary based on this mismatch between the abstract and summary. Please provide the correct summary for the \"Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation\" paper",
