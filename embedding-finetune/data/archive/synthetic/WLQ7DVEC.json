  "note": "ately, the provided summary does not seem to be about \"Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models\". It appears to be discussing a different paper about a model called \"phi-3-mini\". I do not have enough context to provide a relevant summary of activities related to the chain-of-thought prompting paper. Could you please provide the actual summary for that paper",
