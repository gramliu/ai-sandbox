  "note": "Today I spent time exploring the exciting field of instruction tuning for large language models. After reading a survey paper on the topic, I learned about the key concepts and latest developments:\n\nIn the morning, I studied the basics of instruction tuning - further training large language models like GPT-3 on datasets of (instruction, output) pairs. This allows the models to better understand and follow human instructions compared to just being trained on next word prediction. I experimented with some open-source instruction tuning datasets like InstructGPT and Alpaca.\n\nAround noon, I tried out some efficient tuning techniques like LoRA and HINT that allow adapting large models to new tasks by only updating a small fraction of parameters. This could enable on-device personalization and task-specific fine-tuning. I fine-tuned a LoRA model on the Alpaca dataset and tested its performance on coding and math tasks.\n\nIn the afternoon, I explored applications of instruction tuning across different domains like vision, speech, medical, and coding. I was impressed by the enhanced capabilities that instruction-tuned models demonstrated on academic benchmarks for these domains. I spent some time analyzing the outputs of a vision+language instruction tuning model on image captioning.\n\nLater in the evening, I read about some criticisms and potential pitfalls of instruction tuning, like models potentially just learning surface patterns from the instruction data. I brainstormed ideas for more robust instruction tuning approaches that could better capture the underlying reasoning required for complex tasks.\n\nOverall, it was a productive day diving into this cutting-edge area of making large language models more controllable and capable through instruction tuning. I'm excited to continue exploring this field and potentially contributing to it through my own research projects.",
