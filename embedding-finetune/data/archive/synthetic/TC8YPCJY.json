  "note": "Today I worked on developing a tool called FacTool to help detect factual errors in text generated by AI language models like ChatGPT. The key steps involved:\n\n1. I started by extracting specific claims or statements from the generated text that need to be fact-checked.\n\n2. For each claim, I generated relevant search queries to find supporting evidence from sources like search engines, code interpreters, and other language models.\n\n3. I used these tools to gather information and evidence related to the factual accuracy of the claims.\n\n4. Finally, I analyzed all the collected evidence to verify whether each claim is factual, partially factual, or non-factual.\n\nThroughout the day, I tested FacTool on various tasks like knowledge-based question answering, code generation, math problem solving, and reviewing scientific literature. The results showed that FacTool powered by GPT-4 can significantly improve factuality detection compared to just relying on the language model itself.\n\nI'm really excited about the potential of FacTool to help audit and improve the factual reliability of AI-generated text across different domains. It was challenging but rewarding to develop a system that can leverage multiple tools and sources of evidence for this critical task.",
