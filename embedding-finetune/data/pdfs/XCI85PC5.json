(2021).\nThe NLP landscape has recently been revolutionized by\nlanguage models (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019;\nBrown et al., 2020,inter alia). Scaling up the size of lan-\nguage models has been shown to confer a range of benefits,\nsuch as improved performance and sample efficiency (Ka-\nplan et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020,inter alia). However,\nscaling up model size alone has not proved sufficient for\nachieving high performance on challenging tasks such as\narithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning (Rae\net al., 2021).\nThis  work  explores  how  the  reasoning  ability  of  large\nlanguage models can be unlocked by a simple method\nmotivated by two ideas.  First, techniques for arithmetic\nreasoning can benefit from generating natural language\nrationales that lead to the final answer.  Prior work has\ngiven models the ability to generate natural language inter-\nmediate steps by training from scratch (Ling et al., 2017)\nor finetuning a pretrained model (Cobbe et al., 2021), in\naddition to neuro-symbolic methods that use formal lan-\nguages instead of natural language (Roy and Roth, 2015;\nChiang and Chen, 2019; Amini et al., 2019; Chen et al.,\n2019). Second, large language models offer the exciting\nprospect of in-context few-shot learning viaprompting.  That is, instead of finetuning a separate\nlanguage model checkpoint for each new task,  one can simply “prompt” the model with a few\ninput–output exemplars demonstrating the task. Remarkably, this has been successful for a range of\nsimple question-answering tasks (Brown et al., 2020).\nBoth of the above ideas,  however,  have key limitations.   For rationale-augmented training and\nfinetuning methods, it is costly to create a large set of high quality rationales, which is much more\ncomplicated than simple input–output pairs used in normal machine learning. For the traditional few-\nshot prompting method used in Brown et al. (2020), it works poorly on tasks that require reasoning\nabilities, and often does not improve substantially with increasing language model scale (Rae et al.,\n2021). In this paper, we combine the strengths of these two ideas in a way that avoids their limitations.\nSpecifically, we explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for reasoning\ntasks, given a prompt that consists of triples:〈input,chain of thought, output〉. Achain of thoughtis\na series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps that lead to the final output, and we refer to\nthis approach aschain-of-thought prompting. An example prompt is shown in Figure 1.\nWe present empirical evaluations on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks,\nshowing that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting, sometimes to a striking\ndegree.  Figure 2 illustrates one such result—on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems\n(Cobbe et al., 2021), chain-of-thought prompting with PaLM 540B outperforms standard prompting\nby a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.  A prompting only approach is\nimportant because it does not require a large training dataset and because a single model checkpoint\ncan perform many tasks without loss of generality. This work underscores how large language models\ncan learn via a few examples with natural language data about the task (c.f. automatically learning\nthe patterns underlying inputs and outputs via a large training dataset).\n2    Chain-of-Thought Prompting\nConsider one’s own thought process when solving a complicated reasoning task such as a multi-step\nmath word problem. It is typical to decompose the problem into intermediate steps and solve each\nbefore giving the final answer:“After Jane gives 2 flowers to her mom she has 10...then after she\ngives 3 to her dad she will have 7...so the answer is 7.”The goal of this paper is to endow language\nmodels with the ability to generate a similarchain of thought—a coherent series of intermediate\nreasoning steps that lead to the final answer for a problem.  We will show that sufficiently large\n2",
    "language models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are\nprovided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.\nFigure 1 shows an example of a model producing a chain of thought to solve a math word problem\nthat it would have otherwise gotten incorrect. The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\ntypically comeafterthe final answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\n2022,inter alia)).\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\nin language models.\n1.\nFirst, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\nthat require more reasoning steps.\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model’s\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\n3.\nThird,  chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in sufficiently large off-the-shelf\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\n3    Arithmetic Reasoning\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021,inter alia). Strikingly, chain-\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\ntask-specific finetuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\n3.1    Experimental Setup\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\nBenchmarks.\nWe consider the following five math word problem benchmarks:(1)theGSM8K\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021),(2)theSVAMPdataset of math word\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021),(3)theASDivdataset of diverse math word\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020),(4)theAQuAdataset of algebraic word problems, and(5)theMAWPS\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\nStandard prompting.For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input–output pairs\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example.  Exemplars are formatted as questions and\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\nChain-of-thought prompting.\nOur proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\nwith chains of thought for prompting—Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20. (These particular exemplars did not undergo\nprompt engineering; robustness is studied in Section 3.4 and Appendix A.2.) To investigate whether\nchain-of-thought prompting in this form can successfully elicit successful reasoning across a range of\n3",

Chains of thought are highlighted. Full prompts in Appendix G.\nmath word problems, we used this single set of eight chain of thought exemplars for all benchmarks\nexcept AQuA, which is multiple choice instead of free response. For AQuA, we used four exemplars\nand solutions from the training set, as given in Appendix Table 21.\nLanguage models.We evaluate five large language models.   The first isGPT-3(Brown et al.,\n2020), for which we use text-ada-001, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001, and text-davinci-002, which\npresumably correspond to InstructGPT models of 350M, 1.3B, 6.7B, and 175B parameters (Ouyang\net al., 2022).The second isLaMDA(Thoppilan et al., 2022), which has models of 422M, 2B, 8B,\n68B, and 137B parameters. The third isPaLM, which has models of 8B, 62B, and 540B parameters.\nThe fourth isUL2 20B(Tay et al., 2022), and the fifth isCodex(Chen et al., 2021, code-davinci-002\nin the OpenAI API). We sample from the models via greedy decoding (though follow-up work shows\nchain-of-thought prompting can be improved by taking the majority final answer over many sampled\ngenerations (Wang et al., 2022a)). For LaMDA, we report averaged results over five random seeds,\nwhere each seed had a different randomly shuffled order of exemplars.  As LaMDA experiments\ndid not show large variance among different seeds, to save compute we report results for a single\nexemplar order for all other models.\n3.2    Results\nThe strongest results of chain-of-thought prompting are summarized in Figure 4, with all experimental\noutputs for each model collection, model size, and benchmark shown in Table 2 in the Appendix.\nThere are three key takeaways. First, Figure 4 shows that chain-of-thought prompting is an emergent\nability of model scale (Wei et al., 2022b). That is, chain-of-thought prompting does not positively\nimpact performance for small models, and only yields performance gains when used with models of\n∼100B parameters. We qualitatively found that models of smaller scale produced fluent but illogical\nchains of thought, leading to lower performance than standard prompting.\n4",

Notably,  chain-of-thought  reasoning\nis an emergent ability of increasing model scale.\nPrior best numbers are from Cobbe et al. (2021)\nfor GSM8K, Jie et al. (2022) for SVAMP, and Lan\net al. (2021) for MAWPS.\nSecond, chain-of-thought prompting has larger\nperformance gains for more-complicated prob-\nlems.   For instance,  for GSM8K (the dataset\nwith the lowest baseline performance), perfor-\nmance more than doubled for the largest GPT\nand PaLM models. On the other hand, for Sin-\ngleOp, the easiest subset of MAWPS which only\nrequires a single step to solve, performance im-\nprovements were either negative or very small\n(see Appendix Table 3).\nThird, chain-of-thought prompting via GPT-3\n175B and PaLM 540B compares favorably to\nprior state of the art, which typically finetunes a\ntask-specific model on a labeled training dataset.\nFigure 4 shows how PaLM 540B uses chain-of-\nthought prompting to achieve new state of the art\non GSM8K, SVAMP, and MAWPS (though note\nthat standard prompting already passed the prior\nbest for SVAMP). On the other two datasets,\nAQuA and ASDiv, PaLM with chain-of-thought\nprompting reaches within 2% of the state of the\nart (Appendix Table 2).\nTo  better  understand  why  chain-of-thought\nprompting works, we manually examined model-\ngenerated chains of thought by LaMDA 137B\nfor GSM8K. Of 50 random examples where the\nmodel returned the correct final answer, all of\nthe generated chains of thought were also log-\nically and mathematically correct except two\nthat coincidentally arrived at the correct answer\n(see Appendix D.1, and Table 8 for examples\nof correct model-generated chains of thought).\nWe also randomly examined 50 random sam-\nples for which the model gave the wrong answer.\nThe summary of this analysis is that 46% of the\nchains of thought were almost correct, barring\nminor mistakes (calculator error, symbol map-\nping error, or one reasoning step missing), and that the other 54% of the chains of thought had major\nerrors in semantic understanding or coherence (see Appendix D.2). To provide a small insight into\nwhy scaling improves chain-of-thought reasoning ability, we performed a similar analysis of errors\nmade by PaLM 62B and whether those errors were fixed by scaling to PaLM 540B. The summary\nis that scaling PaLM to 540B fixes a large portion of one-step missing and semantic understanding\nerrors in the 62B model (see Appendix A.1).\n3.3    Ablation Study\nThe observed benefits of using chain-of-thought prompting raises the natural question of whether the\nsame performance improvements can be conferred via other types of prompting. Figure 5 shows an\nablation study with three variations of chain of thought described below.\nEquation only.One reason for why chain-of-thought prompting might help is that it produces the\nmathematical equation to be evaluated, and so we test a variation where the model is prompted\nto output only a mathematical equation before giving the answer.  Figure 5 shows that equation\nonly prompting does not help much for GSM8K, which implies that the semantics of the questions\nin GSM8K are too challenging to directly translate into an equation without the natural language\nreasoning steps in chain of thought. For datasets of one-step or two-step problems, however, we find\nthat equation only prompting does improve performance, since the equation can be easily derived\nfrom the question (see Appendix Table 6).\n5",

To isolate the effect\nof variable computation from chain-of-thought reasoning, we\ntest a configuration where the model is prompted to output a\nonly sequence of dots (...) equal to the number of characters in\nthe equation needed to solve the problem. This variant performs\nabout the same as the baseline, which suggests that variable\ncomputation by itself is not the reason for the success of chain-\nof-thought prompting, and that there appears to be utility from\nexpressing intermediate steps via natural language.\nChain of thought after answer.Another potential benefit of\nchain-of-thought prompting could simply be that such prompts\nallow the model to better access relevant knowledge acquired\nduring pretraining. Therefore, we test an alternative configura-\ntion where the chain of thought prompt is only given after the\nanswer, isolating whether the model actually depends on the\nproduced chain of thought to give the final answer. This variant\nperforms about the same as the baseline, which suggests that\nthe sequential reasoning embodied in the chain of thought is\nuseful for reasons beyond just activating knowledge.\n3.4    Robustness of Chain of Thought\nGSM8K\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nSolve rate (%)\nStandard prompting\nChain-of-thought prompting\n·different annotator (B)\n·different annotator (C)\n·intentionally concise style\n·exemplars from GSM8K (α)\n·exemplars from GSM8K (β)\n·exemplars from GSM8K (γ)\nMAWPS\n0\n20\n40\n60\nFigure 6:  Chain-of-thought prompting\nhas variance for different prompt exam-\nples (as expected) but outperforms stan-\ndard prompting for various annotators as\nwell as for different exemplars.\nSensitivity to exemplars is a key consideration of prompt-\ning approaches—for instance, varying the permutation of\nfew-shot exemplars can cause the accuracy of GPT-3 on\nSST-2 to range from near chance (54.3%) to near state of\nthe art (93.4%) (Zhao et al., 2021).  In this final subsec-\ntion, we evaluate robustness to chains of thought written\nby different annotators.  In addition to the results above,\nwhich used chains of thought written by an Annotator\nA, two other co-authors of this paper (Annotators B and\nC) independently wrote chains of thought for the same\nfew-shot exemplars (shown in Appendix H). Annotator A\nalso wrote another chain of thought that was more concise\nthan the original, following the style of solutions given in\nCobbe et al. (2021).\n1\nFigure 6 shows these results for LaMDA 137B on GSM8K\nand MAWPS (ablation results for other datasets are given\nin Appendix Table 6 / Table 7). Although there is variance\namong different chain of thought annotations, as would be\nexpected when using exemplar-based prompting (Le Scao\nand Rush, 2021; Reynolds and McDonell, 2021; Zhao\net al., 2021), all sets of chain of thought prompts outper-\nform the standard baseline by a large margin. This result\nimplies that successful use of chain of thought does not\ndepend on a particular linguistic style.\nTo confirm that successful chain-of-thought prompting\nworks for other sets of exemplars, we also run experiments\nwith three sets of eight exemplars randomly sampled from the GSM8K training set, an independent\n1\nFor instance, whereas original chain of thought uses several short sentences (“’There were originally 9\ncomputers. For each of 4 days, 5 more computers were added. So 5 * 4 = 20 computers were added. 9 + 20 is\n29.”), the concise chain of thought would read“5 * 4 = 20 new computers were added. So there are 9 + 20 = 29\nnew computers in the server room now”.\n6",
    "source (examples in this dataset already included reasoning steps like a chain of thought).\n2\nFig-\nure 6 shows that these prompts performed comparably with our manually written exemplars, also\nsubstantially outperforming standard prompting.\nIn addition to robustness to annotators, independently-written chains of thought, different exemplars,\nand various language models, we also find that chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic reasoning\nis robust to different exemplar orders and varying numbers of exemplars (see Appendix A.2).\n4    Commonsense Reasoning\nAlthough chain of thought is particularly suitable for math word problems, the language-based nature\nof chain of thought actually makes it applicable to a broad class of commonsense reasoning problems,\nwhich involve reasoning about physical and human interactions under the presumption of general\nbackground knowledge. Commonsense reasoning is key for interacting with the world and is still\nbeyond the reach of current natural language understanding systems (Talmor et al., 2021).\nBenchmarks.We consider five datasets covering a diverse range of commonsense reasoning types.\nThe popularCSQA(Talmor et al., 2019) asks commonsense questions about the world involving\ncomplex semantics that often require prior knowledge.StrategyQA(Geva et al., 2021) requires\nmodels to infer a multi-hop strategy to answer questions. We choose two specialized evaluation sets\nfrom the BIG-bench effort (BIG-bench collaboration, 2021):DateUnderstanding, which involves\ninferring a date from a given context, andSportsUnderstanding, which involves determining whether\na sentence relating to sports is plausible or implausible.  Finally, theSayCandataset (Ahn et al.,\n2022) involves mapping a natural language instruction to a sequence of robot actions from a discrete\nset. Figure 3 shows examples with chain of thought annotations for all datasets.\nPrompts.\nWe follow the same experimental setup as the prior section. For CSQA and StrategyQA,\nwe randomly selected examples from the training set and manually composed chains of thought for\nthem to use as few-shot exemplars. The two BIG-bench tasks do not have training sets, so we selected\nthe first ten examples as exemplars in the evaluation set as few-shot exemplars and report numbers on\nthe rest of the evaluation set. For SayCan, we use six examples from the training set used in Ahn et al.\n(2022) and also manually composed chains of thought.\nResults.Figure 7 highlights these results for PaLM (full results for LaMDA, GPT-3, and different\nmodel scales are shown in Table 4). For all tasks, scaling up model size improved the performance\nof standard prompting; chain-of-thought prompting led to further gains, with improvements appear-\ning to be largest for PaLM 540B.

We  show  that  chain-of-\nthought prompting not only enables language models to\nperform symbolic reasoning tasks that are challenging in\nthe standard prompting setting, but also facilitates length\ngeneralization to inference-time inputs longer than those\nseen in the few-shot exemplars.\nTasks.We use the following two toy tasks.\n•Last letter concatenation.This task asks the model\nto concatenate the last letters of words in a name (e.g.,\n“Amy Brown”→“yn”). It is a more challenging version\nof first letter concatenation, which language models can\nalready perform without chain of thought.\n3\nWe generate\nfull names by randomly concatenating names from the\ntop one-thousand first and last names from name census\ndata (https://namecensus.com/).\n•Coin flip.This task asks the model to answer whether a\ncoin is still heads up after people either flip or don’t flip\nthe coin (e.g.,“A coin is heads up. Phoebe flips the coin.\nOsvaldo does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up?”\n→“no”).\nAs the construction of these symbolic reasoning tasks is\nwell-defined, for each task we consider anin-domaintest\nset for which examples had the same number of steps as\nthe training/few-shot exemplars, as well as anout-of-domain(OOD) test set, for which evaluation\nexamples had more steps than those in the exemplars. For last letter concatenation, the model only\nsees exemplars of names with two words, and then performs last letter concatenation on names with 3\nand 4 words.\n4\nWe do the same for the number of potential flips in the coin flip task. Our experimental\nsetup uses the same methods and models as in the prior two sections. We again manually compose\nchains of thought for the few-shot exemplars for each task, which are given in Figure 3.\nResults.The results of these in-domain and OOD evaluations are shown in Figure 8 for PaLM,\nwith results for LaMDA shown in Appendix Table 5. With PaLM 540B, chain-of-thought prompting\nleads to almost 100% solve rates (note that standard prompting already solves coin flip with PaLM\n540, though not for LaMDA 137B). Note that these in-domain evaluations are “toy tasks” in the\nsense that perfect solution structures are already provided by the chains of thought in the few-shot\nexemplars; all the model has to do is repeat the same steps with the new symbols in the test-time\nexample. And yet, small models still fail—the ability to perform abstract manipulations on unseen\nsymbols for these three tasks only arises at the scale of 100B model parameters.\nAs for the OOD evaluations, standard prompting fails for both tasks. With chain-of-thought prompting,\nlanguage models achieve upward scaling curves (though performance is lower than in the in-domain\nsetting). Hence, chain-of-thought prompting facilitates length generalization beyond seen chains of\nthought for language models of sufficient scale.\n6    Discussion\nWe have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple mechanism for eliciting multi-step rea-\nsoning behavior in large language models. We first saw that chain-of-thought prompting improves\nperformance by a large margin on arithmetic reasoning, yielding improvements that are much stronger\nthan ablations and robust to different annotators, exemplars, and language models (Section 3). Next,\n3\nWe tested 10 common names using GPT-3davinciand it got all but one correct.\n4\nFor names of length longer than 2 words, we concatenate multiple first and last names together.\n8",
    "experiments on commonsense reasoning underscored how the linguistic nature of chain-of-thought\nreasoning makes it generally applicable (Section 4). Finally, we showed that for symbolic reasoning,\nchain-of-thought prompting facilitates OOD generalization to longer sequence lengths (Section 5). In\nall experiments, chain-of-thought reasoning is elicited simply by prompting an off-the-shelf language\nmodel. No language models were finetuned in the process of writing this paper.\nThe emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale has been a prevailing theme\n(Wei et al., 2022b). For many reasoning tasks where standard prompting has a flat scaling curve, chain-\nof-thought prompting leads to dramatically increasing scaling curves. Chain-of-thought prompting\nappears to expand the set of tasks that large language models can perform successfully—in other\nwords, our work underscores that standard prompting only provides a lower bound on the capabilities\nof large language models. This observation likely raises more questions than it answers—for instance,\nhow much more can we expect reasoning ability to improve with a further increase in model scale?\nWhat other prompting methods might expand the range of tasks that language models can solve?\nAs for limitations, we first qualify that although chain of thought emulates the thought processes of\nhuman reasoners, this does not answer whether the neural network is actually “reasoning,” which\nwe leave as an open question. Second, although the cost of manually augmenting exemplars with\nchains of thought is minimal in the few-shot setting, such annotation costs could be prohibitive for\nfinetuning (though this could potentially be surmounted with synthetic data generation, or zero-shot\ngeneralization). Third, there is no guarantee of correct reasoning paths, which can lead to both correct\nand incorrect answers; improving factual generations of language models is an open direction for\nfuture work (Rashkin et al., 2021; Ye and Durrett, 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022,inter alia). Finally,\nthe emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning only at large model scales makes it costly to serve in\nreal-world applications; further research could explore how to induce reasoning in smaller models.\n7    Related Work\nThis work is inspired by many research areas, which we detail in an extended related work section\n(Appendix C). Here we describe two directions and associated papers that are perhaps most relevant.\nThe first relevant direction is using intermediate steps to solve reasoning problems. Ling et al. (2017)\npioneer the idea of using natural language rationales to solve math word problems through a series\nof intermediate steps. Their work is a remarkable contrast to the literature using formal languages\nto reason (Roy et al., 2015; Chiang and Chen, 2019; Amini et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019). Cobbe\net al. (2021) extend Ling et al. (2017) by creating a larger dataset and using it to finetune a pretrained\nlanguage model rather than training a model from scratch.  In the domain of program synthesis,\nNye et al. (2021) leverage language models to predict the final outputs of Python programs via\nfirst line-to-line predicting the intermediate computational results, and show that their step-by-step\nprediction method performs better than directly predicting the final outputs.\nNaturally, this paper also relates closely to the large body of recent work on prompting. Since the\npopularization of few-shot prompting as given by Brown et al. (2020), several general approaches\nhave improved the prompting ability of models, such as automatically learning prompts (Lester et al.,\n2021) or giving models instructions describing a task (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022; Ouyang\net al., 2022).  Whereas these approaches improve or augment the input part of the prompt (e.g.,\ninstructions that are prepended to inputs), our work takes the orthogonal direction of augmenting the\noutputs of language models with a chain of thought.\n8    Conclusions\nWe have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple and broadly applicable method for enhanc-\ning reasoning in language models. Through experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense\nreasoning, we find that chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale that allows\nsufficiently large language models to perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have flat scaling curves.\nBroadening the range of reasoning tasks that language models can perform will hopefully inspire\nfurther work on language-based approaches to reasoning.\n9",

    "A    Frequently Asked Questions\nA.1    Why does increasing model scale improve chain-of-thought prompting?\nThe finding that successful chain-of-thought reasoning predictably emerges only at certain model\nscales is intriguing. Scaling up language models has been shown to confer benefits such as improved\nperformance and sample efficiency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The “other category” included\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters fixed a substantial portion of errors in all\nthree categories. Examples of semantic understanding and one-step missing errors that were fixed by\nscaling PaLM to 540B are given in Figure 10. This result appears consistent with a hypothesis that\nlanguage models acquire a range of semantic understanding and logical reasoning skills as a function\nof model scale (though note that model scale is often conflated with other factors, such as amount of\ntraining compute).\nSemantic understanding\n\n(62B made 20 errors of this type, \n540B fixes 6 of them)\nOne step missing\n\n(62B made 18 errors of this type, \n540B fixes 12 of them)\nOther\n\n(62B made 7 errors of this type, \n540B fixes 4 of them)\nTypes of errors made by \na 62B language model:\nErrors fixed by \nscaling from \n62B to 540B\nFigure 9:   Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. These errors were categorized\nthat semantic understanding, one step missing, and other. The other category includes hallucinations,\nrepetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. Scaling PaLM to 540B fixed a substantial portion of\nerrors in all categories.\nThere are also three notable points regarding why small language models fail. The first observation\nis that small language models fail at even relatively easy symbol mapping tasks. As demonstrated\nin Section 5, for even symbolic reasoning tasks that only require generalization to new examples\nusing the same chain of thought logical structure that was given in the few-shot exemplars, small\nlanguage models still failed.  The second observation is that small language models seem to have\ninherently weaker arithmetic abilities, as shown by Brown et al. (2020), the ability to do simple\narithmetic operations (without semantic understanding) requires sufficient model scale. Finally, we\nnoticed qualitatively that small language models often did not generate a final answer that could be\nparsed, due to either repetitions or logic that never arrived at a final answer.\nIn summary, the success of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale is a complicated\nphenomena that likely involves a variety of emergent abilities (semantic understanding, symbol\nmapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc). Future work could more thoroughly\ninvestigate what properties of pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization objective causally\nenable such reasoning capabilities.\n16",

There is no shortage\nof work showing that prompts affect language models in unexpected ways (Min et al., 2022). The\ngeneral way that we created chain of thought annotations was by taking eight exemplars from the\ntraining set and decomposing the reasoning process into multiple steps leading to the final answer.\nExamples of chain of thought annotations are provided in Figure 3, with full prompts given in\nAppendix G. To analyze how sensitive chain of thought is to prompt engineering, we performed\nrobustness experiments with respect to various factors.\n•Different annotators.\nWe first analyze robustness to three different annotators (Section 3.4 and\nFigure 6). Although there is notable variance in performance (which we will discuss later), chain\nof thought performed better than the baseline by a large margin for all three annotators on eight\ndatasets in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning (Table 6 and Table 7). Similar to the\nannotation process in Cobbe et al. (2021), annotators were not given specific instructions about\n17",
    "how to write the chain of thought annotations other than to simply write the step-by-step reasoning\nprocess that led to the final answer. Thus, the annotations were written in each annotator’s own\nlinguistic “chain of thought” writing style.\n•Annotators without machine learning background.The GSM8K dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021)\nconveniently provides a training set with reasoning chains written by crowd compute workers,\nwhich enables us to investigate whether chain of thought still works with reasoning chains from an\nindependent source without a background in machine learning. So we randomly sampled three sets\nof eight exemplars with chains of thought from GSM8K. These chain of thought annotations also\noutperformed the baseline by a large margin for all four arithmetic datasets (Table 6), indicating\nthat chain of thought is not dependent on a particular set of annotators.\n•Different exemplars.The different GSM8K exemplars experiment above (Table 6) also shows\nthat chain-of-thought prompting works for different sets of exemplars. Notably, we test every set of\nexemplars on all four arithmetic datasets (instead of picking exemplars from the training set for\neach dataset), which suggests that the exemplars do not necessarily have to come from the same\ndataset distribution as the test examples.\n•Different order of exemplars.Prior work has shown that in some cases (e.g., classification) even\nthe order of prompts matter—varying the permutation of few-shot exemplars can cause the accuracy\nof GPT-3 on SST-2 to range from near chance (54.3%) to near SOTA (93.4%) (Zhao et al., 2021).\nWe show the standard deviation of performance from different exemplars in Table 6 and Table 7.\nStandard deviations with respect to prompt order are relatively minimal in almost all cases. The\none exception is the coin flip task, for which exemplar orders have high standard deviation, likely\nfor the reason cited in Zhao et al. (2021)—for classification, many exemplars of the same category\nin a row biases the model outputs).\n•Different number of exemplars.\nWe also found that gains from chain-of-thought prompting\ngenerally still held when there was a varying number of few-shot exemplars. This is shown for five\ndatasets in Figure 11 (we did not have the compute to run this for all datasets). We also found in\npreliminary experiments that further increasing the number of exemplars in standard prompting\ndid not lead to significant gains (e.g., increasing from 8 to 16 exemplars did not improve the\nperformance of standard prompting enough to catch up with chain-of-thought prompting).\n•Different language models.Another interesting question is whether certain prompts that work\nbetter for one model work better for other large language models.  We find that with the same\nprompts, chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all three models (LaMDA,\nGPT-3, and PaLM) for all datasets except CSQA and StrategyQA for GPT-3 (Table 1, Table 4,\nTable 5).  The fact that gains from chain of thought did not transfer perfectly among models is\na limitation; further work could investigate why how different pre-training datasets and model\narchitectures affect the performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting.\nPrompt engineering still matters, though.Although the results are relatively robust to the prompt\nfor arithmetic reasoning, we want to be clear that prompt engineering still does matter, and can\nimprove  performance  significantly  in  many  cases.   Though  most  chain  of  thought  annotations\noutperform standard prompting, there is large variation in many cases.  For instance, for the coin\nflip task, the performance varied from 99.6% for Annotator A to 71.4% for Annotator C, though\nboth were above standard prompting = 50.0% (see Table 7).  There are even tasks where prompt\nengineering is a requirement for good performance. In preliminary experiments, we tried using chain\nof thought to enable language models to reverse the order of a list of 5 items. While two co-authors\nwere not able to write chain of thought prompts that solved the task despite their best attempts, a third\nco-author was able to write a chain of thought that perfectly solved the task.\nHow to generate chain of thought annotations in a robust fashion could be an interesting direction\nfor future work. For instance, an idea here could be to use a large language model to automatically\ngenerate chains of thought via prompting (and potentially optimize this over a validation set).\nA.3    Will chain-of-thought prompting improve performance for my task of interest?\nWhile chain-of-thought prompting is in principle applicable for any text-to-text task, it is more\nhelpful for some tasks than others. Based on the experiments in this paper, our intuition is that chain\nof thought helps the most when three conditions are met: (1) the task is challenging and requires\n18",
    "multi-step reasoning, (2) a large language model is used, and (3) the scaling curve is relatively flat.\nConversely, the benefits are smaller when one or more of these conditions are not met.\nThese intuitions are perhaps supported by the arithmetic reasoning results. The performance gain\nfrom chain-of-thought prompting is largest for PaLM 540B on GSM8K (challenging multi-step\nproblems, flat scaling curve), which meets these conditions. The performance gain is small for the\nsubsets of MAWPS that only require one or two steps (SingleOP, SingleEq, and AddSub), for which\nPaLM 540B already achieves performance of 90% or higher (and it is also generally true that there is\nless headroom for improvement when performance is already strong).\nAlthough in this paper we focused on multi-step reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, and\nsymbolic), chain-of-thought prompting can potentially be applied to any task for which humans use a\n“chain of thought” to solve (at least in principle). We leave the empirical evaluation of chain-of-thought\nprompting on such diverse tasks (e.g., machine translation, etc.) to future work.\nA.4    Why is prompting with the equation only not enough for some arithmetic reasoning\ndatasets?\nPrompting with the equation only as an intermediate step does help on many datasets, especially when\nthe datasets only require a few reasoning steps (SVAMP, ASDiv, MAWPS). For GSM8K, however,\nusing the equation only did not improve performance substantially. Based on qualitative analysis, we\nbelieve that these questions are too semantically challenging for the model to directly translate them\ninto a math equation. Consider this example from LaMDA 137B:\nQUESTION:Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes.  In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4\npoints. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. How many total points did he\nscore?\nEQUATION ONLY(WRONG ANSWER):(4 + 20 * 0.25) = 6. The answer is 6.\nCHAIN  OF  THOUGHT(CORRECT):Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes.  In the first\n20 minutes, he scored 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points. So\nhe scored 25% more in the second 20 minutes. 4 x 1.25 = 5. So he scored 5 points in the\nsecond 20 minutes. So he scored 9 points in total. The answer is 9.\nIt is hard for the model to directly translate all of the semantics into a single equation, but chain of\nthought allows it to better reason about each part of the question via intermediate steps in natural\nlanguage.\n19",
    "B    All Experimental Results\nThis section contains tables for experimental results for varying models and model sizes, on all\nbenchmarks, for standard prompting vs. chain-of-thought prompting.\nFor the arithmetic reasoning benchmarks, some chains of thought (along with the equations produced)\nwere correct, except the model performed an arithmetic operation incorrectly. A similar observation\nwas made in Cobbe et al. (2021).  Hence, we can further add a Python program as an external\ncalculator (using the Pythonevalfunction) to all the equations in the generated chain of thought.\nWhen there are multiple equations in a chain of thought, we propagate the external calculator results\nfrom one equation to the following equations via string matching. As shown in Table 1, we see that\nadding a calculator significantly boosts performance of chain-of-thought prompting on most tasks.\nTable 1:   Chain of thought prompting outperforms standard prompting for various large language\nmodels on five arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.

    "C    Extended Related Work\nChain-of-thought prompting is a general approach that is inspired by several prior directions: prompt-\ning, natural language explanations, program synthesis/execution, numeric and logical reasoning, and\nintermediate language steps.\nC.1    Prompting\nThe recent success of large-scale language models has led to growing interest in improving their\ncapability to perform tasks via prompting (Brown et al. (2020), and see Liu et al. (2021) for a\nsurvey). This paper falls in the category of general prompting approaches, whereby input prompts are\noptimized to allow a single large language model to better perform a variety of tasks (Li and Liang,\n2021; Lester et al., 2021; Reif et al., 2022,inter alia).\nOne recent line of work aims to improve the ability of language models to perform a task by providing\ninstructions that describe the task (Raffel et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022a; Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b). This line of work is related because it also augments input–output\npairs with meta-data. But whereas an instruction augments the input to a task (instructions are typically\nprepended to the inputs), chain-of-thought prompting augments the outputs of language models.\nAnother related direction is sequentially combining the outputs of language models; human–computer\ninteraction (HCI) work (Wu et al., 2022a,b) has shown that combining sequential generations of\nlanguage models improves task outcomes in a 20-person user study.\nC.2    Natural language explanations\nAnother closely related direction uses natural language explanations (NLEs), often with the goal of\nimproving model interpretability (Zhou et al., 2020; Wiegreffe and Marasovi\n ́\nc, 2021,inter alia). That\nline of work typically focuses on natural language inference (Camburu et al., 2018; Yordanov et al.,\n2021; Bostrom et al., 2021), and produces explanations either simultaneously to or after the final\nprediction (Narang et al., 2020; Majumder et al., 2021; Wiegreffe et al., 2021, 2022). By contrast,\nthe chain of thought processing considered in this paper occursbeforethe final answer. And while\nNLE aims mostly to improve neural network interpretability (Rajagopal et al., 2021), the goal of\nchain-of-thought prompting is to allow models to decompose multi-hop reasoning tasks into multiple\nsteps—interpretability is just a side effect. Marasovi\n ́\nc et al. (2022) show that prompt-based finetuning\nwith NLE improves NLI and classification performance, though they largely focus on evaluating\nexplanation plausibility. In comparison, our work focuses on a range of arithmetic, commonsense,\nand symbolic tasks that require multi-hop reasoning.\nC.3    Program synthesis and execution\nUsing intermediate reasoning steps has a long history in program synthesis and execution (Zaremba\nand Sutskever, 2014,inter alia).  Recent work along in this direction has included a number of\narchitectural innovations (Cai et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2020), as well as the use of\nlarge language models (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021). The program execution work closest to\nours is perhaps Nye et al. (2021), which show that large language models can perform up to 10-digit\naddition, evaluate polynomials, and execute python programs. Whereas generating a program and\nthen executing it can be viewed as a type of reasoning, our work generalizes such domain-specific\nprimitives to natural language, which is open-domain and relevant to any text-to-text NLP task in\nprinciple.\nC.4    Numeric and logical reasoning\nNumeric and logical reasoning has been a long-studied task in machine learning and natural language\nprocessing (Lev et al., 2004,inter alia).  Recent work has also aimed to inject numeric reasoning\nabilities in language models in various ways, such as augmenting BERT with a predefined set of\nexecutable operations (Andor et al., 2019), including a graph neural network (Ran et al., 2019), and\nusing specialized training procedures (Pi ̨ekos et al., 2021).  Another line of work aims to enable\nlanguage models to perform logical or formal reasoning, often by verablizing the rules in natural\nlanguage formal rules using language (Clark et al., 2020; Saeed et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021).\n24",
    "Perhaps the most-related work here is Recchia (2021), which shows that finetuning enables longhand\nmodule operations, which has previously been difficult for performers. Whereas work in this direction\nis often task-specific and uses finetuning, we show that chain-of-thought prompting works for a broad\nrange of tasks without any finetuning.\nC.5    Intermediate language steps\nExtensive prior work has shown the benefits of endowing neural networks with the ability to produce\nintermediate steps via training or finetuning confers various benefits in a range of scenarios.  As\nexamples, it has been shown that natural language intermediate steps can improve performance\n(Zaidan et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2021; Hase and Bansal, 2022; Gu et al., 2022), improve robustness\n(Chen et al., 2022), speed up training (Hancock et al., 2018), mitigate bias (Dua et al., 2020), and\neven help in image and reinforcement learning settings (Andreas et al., 2018). To endow models with\nthe ability to produce intermediate steps, prior work typically finetunes models on either manually\nannotated training datasets (Camburu et al., 2018; Rajani et al., 2019,inter alia) or generates synthetic\ndatasets (Talmor et al., 2020; Zelikman et al., 2022).  Compared with these training or finetuning\nmethods, our work shows that various natural language reasoning abilities can be elicited in off-the-\nshelf language models of sufficient scale simply via prompting. This prompting setup is important\nbecause it allows for intermediate step reasoning without a large number of labeled annotations, and\nbecause a single model can perform a range of reasoning tasks without any gradient updates.\nD    Appendix: Additional Analysis\nD.1    Correct Chain of Thought Analysis\nAs mentioned in the main text, we analyze 50 chains of thought from LaMDA 137B that led to\ncorrect answers in the GSM8K dataset. Of these 50, only one arrived at the correct answer through\nincorrect reasoning (shown in Table 9:  “correct by chance”).  The other 49 had correct logic and\nmath, with examples shown in Table 8. Five had minor imperfections while maintaining coherent and\nunderstandable logic:\n•  One had underspecified statements (shown in Table 9: “correct but underspecified statements”).\n•\nOne made an unrelated but correct statement (shown in Table 9: “correct but unrelated statement”).\n•Two had the correct logic but omitted specific steps in the equation, though it was still understand-\nable (shown in Table 9: “correct but imperfect equation”).\n•One had the correct math but inverted the semantics (shown in Table 9:  “correct but inverted\nsemantics”)\nTable 8:  Example of correct chains of thought produced by the model for the GSM8K dataset.\nQUESTION:James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total\nmeters does he run a week?\nMODELANSWER(CORRECT):James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each\nsprint. So he runs 60 meters x 3 sprints x 3 times a week. That is 60 meters x 9. The answer is 540.X\nQUESTION:Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s iPhone. Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s\niPhone. If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, how old is Brandon’s iPhone?\nMODELANSWER(CORRECT):Brandon’s iPhone is 4 times as old as Ben’s iPhone.  Ben’s iPhone is 2\ntimes older than Suzy’s iPhone. So Brandon’s iPhone is 4 x 2 = 8 times older than Suzy’s iPhone. Suzy’s iPhone\nis 1 year old. So Brandon’s iPhone is 8 x 1 = 8 years old. The answer is 8.X\nQUESTION:Jean has 30 lollipops.  Jean eats 2 of the lollipops.  With the remaining lollipops, Jean wants to\npackage 2 lollipops in one bag. How many bags can Jean fill?\nMODELANSWER(CORRECT):Jean started with 30 lollipops. She ate 2 of them. So she has 28 lollipops\nleft. She wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. So she can package 28 / 2 = 14 bags. The answer is 14.X\nAlthough we find that chain-of-thought reasoning is mostly correct for math questions where the final\nanswer was correct, this is likely because it is hard to arrive at the correct final answer by coincidence\nfor free response questions. For multiple choice or binary classification problems, it was much more\n25",
    "likely that models could arrive at the correct answer via an incorrect reasoning path (e.g., all the\ncommmonsense reasoning datasets we evaluate). This is a limitation, and future work should perform\nan analysis of the factuality of such chains of thought.\nTable 9:  Of 50 examples that the model got correct, there were 7 salient cases where the chain of\nthought the model generated was imperfect. We found the other 43 to be equivalent to what a human\nwould potentially generate as a ground truth.\nQUESTION:There are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow. One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean.\nAnother one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. How many penguins are still left sunbathing?\nMODELANSWER(CORRECT BY CHANCE):There are 36 penguins. One-third of them jump in and swim in\nthe ocean. So that is 12 penguins. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. So that is 12 penguins.\nThe answer is 12.\nQUESTION:John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each.  Each bedroom has 2 windows each.  There are an\nadditional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. How many total windows are there between the\nhouses?\nMODELANSWER(CORRECT BUT UNDERSPECIFIED STATEMENTS):There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms\neach. Each bedroom has 2 windows each. So there are 2 x 3 = 6 windows in each house. There are an additional\n4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. So there are 4 + 4 = 8 windows in each house. So there are\n6 x 2 = 12 windows in each house. So there are 12 + 8 = 20 windows in both houses. The answer is 20.\nQUESTION:If Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, how old will her brother be in 3 years?\nMODELANSWER(CORRECT BUT UNRELATED STATEMENT):Ann is 9 years old. Her brother is twice her\nage. So her brother is 18 years old. In 3 years, she will be 12. So her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old. The\nanswer is 21.\nQUESTION:A local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon. An app company is offering $.20 cashback per\ngallon if you fill up at this station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much with their gas be, after the\ncashback rewards?\nMODELANSWER(CORRECT  BUT  IMPERFECT  EQUATION):\nThe gas is originally 3 dollars per gallon. If\nyou buy 10 gallons, that is 3 x 10 = 30 dollars. If you get 20 cents off per gallon, that is 20 x 10 = 2 dollars. So\nthe total is 30 - 2 = 28 dollars. The answer is 28 dollars.\nQUESTION:Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store’s Santa village. A third of\nthe elves quit after children vomit on them, then 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. How\nmany elves are left?\nMODELANSWER(CORRECT  BUT  IMPERFECT  EQUATION):\nNissa hires 60 seasonal workers.  A third of\nthem quit. So 60 - 1/3 = 40 elves are left. Then 10 elves quit. So 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left. The answer is 30\nelves.\nQUESTION:Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman’s luncheon. She cut each pie into 8 pieces and\nset the five pies out on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves. At the end of the evening, after the\nguests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. How many pieces were\ntaken by the guests?\nMODELANSWER(CORRECT BUT INVERTED SEMANTICS):5 pies were baked and cut into 8 pieces each.\nThe 5 pies were then served to the guests. 8 x 5 = 40 pieces of pie. The guests ate 14 pieces of pie. 40 - 14 = 26\npieces of pie were left. The answer is 26.X\n26",
    "D.2    Incorrect Chain of Thought Analysis\nWe also manually analyze 50 randomly sampled outputs of the model that were incorrect on GSM8K\nfor LaMDA 137B. There are many ways that a chain of thought can be incorrect, making the design\nof error categorization non-trivial. We decided to categorize errors into what changes are needed to\nmake the chain of thought correct, with the goal of elucidating how the model can be improved in the\nfuture.\nWe found that many chains of thought can be made correct with one of the following three classes of\nmodification.\n•Calculator error only.We found that 8% of the chains of thought were completely correct except\nfor a calculator error—in other words, applying an external calculator to equations, as done in\nCobbe et al. (2021), would make the chain of thought correct. An example of this type of error is\nshown in Table 10: “calculator error only”. Indeed, the solve rate of chain-of-thought prompting\non for LaMDA 137B GSM8K went up from 14.3% to 17.3% when we added a Python program\nas an external calculator, as shown in Table 2.  Also, 34% of the examples contained calculator\nerrors in addition to other types of errors. However, we perform the rest of the error categorization\nindependently of calculator errors.\n•Symbol mapping error.We next found that 16% percent of the chains of thought were correct\nexcept for what we call symbol mapping errors. We define a symbol mapping error as when the\nchain of thought is correct except for the number symbols, and it could be made totally correct by\nmodifying only the equations and not the words. As one might argue that they could simply place\nthe correct final equation in any chain of thought, we constrain this category to chains of thought\nwhere the chain of thought can be modified to be a completely correct reasoning process (not just\nfinal answer). An example of this error category is shown in Table 10: “symbol mapping error”.\n•One step missing error.Our next category of error is chains of thought which were correct except\nthat they were missing a single step. In other words, these chains of thoughts could be rewritten to\nbe correct by adding in an additional reasoning step that was missed by the model. An example of\nthis error category is shown in Table 10: “one step missing error”. We found that 22% percent of\nthe errors fell into this category.\nTable 10:  Example of incorrect chains of thought, categorized as described in Appendix D.2.\nQUESTION:Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns\nare there total?\nMODELANSWER(INCORRECT;CALCULATOR ERROR ONLY):Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush\nhas 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. So 3 x 25 x 8 = 300. The answer is 300.7\nEXPLANATION  FORERRORCATEGORY:The produced chain of thought could be made correct just by\nrunning the equation through an external calculator, instead of asking the model to do the computation.\nQUESTION:Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a\nyear, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what’s her annual salary?\nMODELANSWER(INCORRECT;SYMBOL  MAPPING  ERROR):\nJill gets paid 20 dollars per hour to teach\nand 30 dollars per hour to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher\nand 15 hours a week as a coach, then she works 50 x 35 = 1750 hours as a teacher and 15 x 30 = 450 hours as a\ncoach. So she works 1750 + 450 = 2200 hours. She gets paid 20 dollars per hour for 1750 hours and 30 dollars\nper hour for 450 hours. So her annual salary is 20 x 1750 + 30 x 450 = $36,500. The answer is $36,500.7\nEXPLANATION FORERRORCATEGORY:The model incorrectly mapped “15 x 30” instead of “15 x 50”, and\nthe chain of thought would be made correct by fixing just that one change (with an external calculator).\nQUESTION:Kelian has two recipes for preparing dishes, one having 20 instructions and the second one having\ntwice as many instructions as the first one. How many instructions does Kelian have to read to prepare the two\ndishes?\nMODELANSWER(INCORRECT;ONE STEP MISSING ERROR):Kelian has two recipes. One has 20 instruc-\ntions. The other has twice as many instructions as the first one. So the second one has 40 instructions. So Kelian\nhas to read 40 instructions to prepare the two dishes. The answer is 40.7\nEXPLANATION FORERRORCATEGORY:The model answer could be made correct just adding one additional\nstep (in this case, adding 20 and 40).\n27",
    "We found that the remaining chains of thought (27 of 50; 54%) would require substantial edits to make\ninto a correct chain of thought. Almost all cases here involved some error in semantic understanding\n(see Table 11: “semantic understanding error”), and 8 of the 27 also had incoherent chain of thoughts,\nmeaning that some statements in the generated chain of thought did not follow from prior ones or\nviolated basic world knowledge (see Table 11: “incoherent chain of thought error”).\nTable 11:   Example of incorrect chains of thought, categorized as described in Appendix D.2.

How many gold coins\ndoes Gretchen have?\nMODELANSWER(INCORRECT;SEMANTIC  UNDERSTANDING  ERROR):Gretchen has 110 coins.  There\nare 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So there are 110 - 30 = 80 silver coins. So there are 80 silver coins and\n110 - 80 = 30 gold coins.

The rest enrolled in hip-hop\ndance.  So the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is the percentage of the students\nenrolled in hip-hop dance, minus the percentage of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, minus the\npercentage of the students enrolled in jazz dance. So the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop\ndance is (25 + 20) - (25 + 20) = 100%. The answer is 100%.7\nEXPLANATION  FORERRORCATEGORY:This chain of thought is incoherent in that the percent of entire\nstudents enrolled in hip-hope dance cannot be the percent of student enrolled in hip-hop dance minus another\nterm.\nOverall, there are no guarantees that the reasoning processes generated by large language models\nare coherent or factually correct, as underscored by the recent work evaluating the factuality of\nlanguage model generations and explanations (Maynez et al., 2020; Rashkin et al., 2021; Ye and\nDurrett, 2022; Marasovi\n ́\nc et al., 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022). Incorrect reasoning processes can lead\nto both incorrect final answers as well as accidentally correct final answers (with accidentally correct\nfinal answers being more likely for tasks such as binary classification as opposed to free response).\nImproving the factuality of language model generations with respect to context and world knowledge\nis an important direction open problems in language model research and could also be expected to\npotentially improve multi-step reasoning abilities of language models.  One potential method for\nimproving the quality of decoding could involve generating multiple reasoning paths and scoring\neach of them with a verifier, though this requires training the verifier (Cobbe et al., 2021; Shen et al.,\n2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022).\nD.3    Additional Robustness Analysis\nAs the experiments in the main paper use a fixed number of few-shot exemplars (8; as constrained by\nthe input length of 1024 tokens), we verify that the chain-of-thought prompting is robust to various\nnumbers of few-shot exemplars. We run experiments for LaMDA 137B, comparing chain-of-thought\nprompting with standard prompting for the five datasets where standard prompting had a mostly flat\nscaling curve (the largest model did not achieve high performance).  As shown in Figure 11, the\nimprovement of chain-of-thought prompting over standard prompting remains robust to varying the\nnumber of few-shot exemplars in the prompt.\n28",

First, we provide the exact input prompts for all\ntasks in Table 20–Table 27 in Appendix G (and emphasize that we do not perform any finetuning and\nonly apply prompting to off-the-shelf language models). Second, we conduct experiments using the\npublicly available GPT-3 API for four model scales text-ada-001, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001,\ntext-davinci-002). Finally, we make exact inputs, targets, and predictions for LaMDA 137B for each\ntask available as a zip file in the supplementary material.\nE.2    Computational Resources\nFor all three language models we evaluated, we did prompting-based inference only. No finetuning\nwas done for this paper. For inference on LaMDA 137B we use TPU v3 (8x8 configuration, 64 chips\n/ 128 cores), and for inference on PaLM 540B we use TPU v4 (4x4x12 configuration, 192 chips / 384\ncores).
