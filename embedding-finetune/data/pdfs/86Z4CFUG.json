    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable\nMultimodal Models\nGemini Team, Google\n1\nThis report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities\nacross image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano\nsizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained\nuse-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model\nadvances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks — notably being the first model to achieve\nhuman-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the\nart in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of\nthe Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of\nuse cases. We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to\nusers through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud Vertex AI.\n1. Introduction\nWe present Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models developed at Google. We trained\nGemini models jointly across image, audio, video, and text data for the purpose of building a model\nwith both strong generalist capabilities across modalities alongside cutting-edge understanding and\nreasoning performance in each respective domain.\nGemini 1.0, our first version, comes in three sizes: Ultra for highly-complex tasks, Pro for enhanced\nperformance and deployability at scale, and Nano for on-device applications. Each size is specifically\ntailored to address different computational limitations and application requirements.\nAfter large-scale pre-training, we post-train our models to improve overall quality, enhance target\ncapabilities, and ensure alignment and safety criteria are met. Due to the varied requirements of\nour downstream applications, we have produced two post-trained Gemini model family variants.\nChat-focused variants, referred to as Gemini Apps models, are optimized for Gemini and Gemini\nAdvanced, our conversational AI service formerly known as Bard. Developer-focused variants, referred\nto as Gemini API models, are optimized for a range of products and are accessible through Google AI\nStudio and Cloud Vertex AI.\nWe evaluate the performance of pre- and post-trained Gemini models on a comprehensive suite\nof internal and external benchmarks covering a wide range of language, coding, reasoning, and\nmultimodal tasks.\nThe Gemini family advances state-of-the-art in large-scale language modeling (Anil et al., 2023;\nBrown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Hoffmann et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023a; Radford et al.,\n2019; Rae et al., 2021), image understanding (Alayrac et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Dosovitskiy\net al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b; Reed et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022a), audio processing (Radford et al.,\n2023; Zhang et al., 2023), and video understanding (Alayrac et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). It\nalso builds on the work on sequence models (Sutskever et al., 2014), a long history of work in deep\nlearning based on neural networks (LeCun et al., 2015), and machine learning distributed systems\n1\nSee Contributions and Acknowledgments section for full author list.

    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\n(Barham et al., 2022; Bradbury et al., 2018; Dean et al., 2012) that enable large-scale training.\nOur most capable model, Gemini Ultra, achieves new state-of-the-art results in 30 of 32 benchmarks\nwe report on, including 10 of 12 popular text and reasoning benchmarks, 9 of 9 image understanding\nbenchmarks, 6 of 6 video understanding benchmarks, and 5 of 5 speech recognition and speech\ntranslation benchmarks. Gemini Ultra is the first model to achieve human-expert performance on\nMMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) — a prominent benchmark testing knowledge and reasoning via a\nsuite of exams — with a score above 90%. Beyond text, Gemini Ultra makes notable advances on\nchallenging multimodal reasoning tasks. For example, on the recent MMMU benchmark (Yue et al.,\n2023), that comprises questions about images on multi-discipline tasks requiring college-level subject\nknowledge and deliberate reasoning, Gemini Ultra achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 62.4%,\noutperforming the previous best model by more than 5 percentage points. It provides a uniform\nperformance lift for video question answering and audio understanding benchmarks.\nQualitative evaluation showcases impressive crossmodal reasoning capabilities, enabling the model\nto understand and reason across an input sequence of audio, images, and text natively (see Figure 5\nand Table 13). Consider the educational setting depicted in Figure 1 as an example. A teacher has\ndrawn a physics problem of a skier going down a slope, and a student has worked through a solution to\nit. Using Gemini models’ multimodal reasoning capabilities, the model is able to understand the messy\nhandwriting, correctly understand the problem formulation, convert both the problem and solution\nto mathematical typesetting, identify the specific step of reasoning where the student went wrong in\nsolving the problem, and then give a worked through correct solution to the problem. This opens up\nexciting educational possibilities, and we believe the new multimodal and reasoning capabilities of\nGemini models have dramatic applications across many fields.\nThe reasoning capabilities of large language models show promise toward building generalist\nagents that can tackle more complex multi-step problems. The AlphaCode team built AlphaCode\n2 (Leblond et al, 2023), a new Gemini-model-powered agent, that combines Gemini models’ rea-\nsoning capabilities with search and tool-use to excel at solving competitive programming problems.\nAlphaCode 2 ranks within the top 15% of entrants on the Codeforces competitive programming\nplatform, a large improvement over its state-of-the-art predecessor in the top 50% (Li et al., 2022).\nIn tandem, we advance the frontier of efficiency with Gemini Nano, a series of small models\ntargeting on-device deployment. These models excel in on-device tasks, such as summarization,\nreading comprehension, text completion tasks, and exhibit impressive capabilities in reasoning, STEM,\ncoding, multimodal, and multilingual tasks relative to their sizes.\nIn the following sections, we first provide an overview of the model architecture, training infras-\ntructure, and pre-training dataset. We then present detailedevaluationsof the pre- and post-trained\nGemini model family, covering well-studied benchmarks across text, code, image, audio and video —\nwhich include both English performance and multilingual capabilities. Next we discuss our approach\nto post-training, highlight common and distinct aspects of the Gemini Apps and Gemini API model\nvariants, and benchmark their performance on key capabilities.Responsible deploymentis critical: we\nexplain our process for impact assessments, developing model policies, evaluations, and mitigations\nof harm before deployment decisions. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of Gemini models,\ntheir limitations alongside their potential applications — paving the way for a new era of research\nand innovation in AI.\n2",

The model is able to correctly recognize\nall of the handwritten content and verify the reasoning. On top of understanding the text in the\nimage, it needs to understand the problem setup and correctly follow instructions to generate L\nA\nT\nE\nX.\n2. Model Architecture\nGemini models build on top of Transformer decoders (Vaswani et al., 2017b) that are enhanced\nwith improvements in architecture and model optimization to enable stable training at scale and\noptimized inference on Google’s Tensor Processing Units. They are trained to support 32k context\nlength, employing efficient attention mechanisms (for e.g. multi-query attention (Shazeer, 2019a)).\nOur first version, Gemini 1.0, comprises three main sizes to support a wide range of applications as\ndiscussed in Table 1.\nGemini models are trained to accommodate textual input interleaved with a wide variety of audio\nand visual inputs, such as natural images, charts, screenshots, PDFs, and videos, and they can produce\ntext and image outputs (see Figure 2). The visual encoding of Gemini models is inspired by our own\nfoundational work on Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), CoCa (Yu et al., 2022a), and PaLI (Chen et al.,\n2022), with the important distinction that the models are multimodal from the beginning and can\nnatively output images using discrete image tokens (Ramesh et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022b).\nVideo understanding is accomplished by encoding the video as a sequence of frames in the large\ncontext window. Video frames or images can be interleaved naturally with text or audio as part of the\nmodel input. The models can handle variable input resolution in order to spend more compute on\ntasks that require fine-grained understanding. In addition, Gemini models can directly ingest audio\n3",

It is\nefficiently serveable at scale on TPU accelerators due to the Gemini architecture.\nProA performance-optimized model in terms of cost as well as latency that delivers\nsignificant performance across a wide range of tasks. This model exhibits strong\nreasoning performance and broad multimodal capabilities.\nNanoOur most efficient model, designed to run on-device. We trained two versions of\nNano, with 1.8B (Nano-1) and 3.25B (Nano-2) parameters, targeting low and high\nmemory devices respectively. It is trained by distilling from larger Gemini models. It\nis 4-bit quantized for deployment and provides best-in-class performance.\nTable 1|An overview of the Gemini 1.0 model family.\nFigure 2|Gemini models support interleaved sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs\n(illustrated by tokens of different colors in the input sequence). They can output responses with\ninterleaved image and text.\nsignals at 16kHz from Universal Speech Model (USM) (Zhang et al., 2023) features. This enables the\nmodel to capture nuances that are typically lost when the audio is naively mapped to a text input (for\nexample, see audio understanding demo on the website).\nTraining the Gemini family of models required innovations in training algorithms, dataset, and\ninfrastructure. For the Pro model, the inherent scalability of our infrastructure and learning algorithms\nenable us to complete pre-training in a matter of weeks, leveraging a fraction of the Ultra’s resources.\nThe Nano series of models leverage additional advancements in distillation and training algorithms\nto produce the best-in-class small language models for a wide variety of tasks, such as summarization\nand reading comprehension, which power our next generation on-device experiences.\n3. Training Infrastructure\nWe trained Gemini models using TPUv5e and TPUv4 (Jouppi et al., 2023), depending on their sizes\nand configuration. Training Gemini Ultra used a large fleet of TPUv4 accelerators owned by Google\n4",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nacross multiple datacenters. This represents a significant increase in scale over our prior flagship\nmodel PaLM-2 which presented new infrastructure challenges. Scaling up the number of accelerators\nresults in a proportionate decrease in the mean time between failure of hardware in the overall system.\nWe minimized the rate of planned reschedules and preemptions, but genuine machine failures are\ncommonplace across all hardware accelerators at such large scales.\nTPUv4 accelerators are deployed in “SuperPods” of 4096 chips, each connected to a dedicated\noptical switch, which can dynamically reconfigure 4x4x4 chip cubes into arbitrary 3D torus topologies\nin around 10 seconds (Jouppi et al., 2023). For Gemini Ultra, we decided to retain a small number of\ncubes per superpod to allow for hot standbys and rolling maintenance.\nTPU accelerators primarily communicate over the high speed inter-chip-interconnect, but at\nGemini Ultra scale, we combine SuperPods in multiple datacenters using Google’s intra-cluster and\ninter-cluster network (Poutievski et al., 2022; Wetherall et al., 2023; yao Hong et al., 2018). Google’s\nnetwork latencies and bandwidths are sufficient to support the commonly used synchronous training\nparadigm, exploiting model parallelism within superpods and data-parallelism across superpods.\nThe ‘single controller’ programming model of Jax (Bradbury et al., 2018) and Pathways (Barham\net al., 2022) allows a single Python process to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically\nsimplifying the development workflow. The GSPMD partitioner (Xu et al., 2021) in the XLA compiler\npartitions the training step computation, and the MegaScale XLA compiler (XLA, 2019) pass statically\nschedules appropriate collectives so that they maximally overlap with the computation with very little\nvariation in step time.\nMaintaining a high goodput\n2\nat this scale would have been impossible using the conventional\napproach of periodic checkpointing of weights to persistent cluster storage. For Gemini models, we\ninstead made use of redundant in-memory copies of the model state, and on any unplanned hardware\nfailures, we rapidly recover directly from an intact model replica. Compared to both PaLM and PaLM-2\n(Anil et al., 2023), this provided a substantial speedup in recovery time, despite the significantly\nlarger training resources being used. As a result, the overall goodput for the largest-scale training job\nincreased from 85% to 97%.\nTraining at unprecedented scale invariably surfaces new and interesting systems failure modes -\nand in this instance one of the problems that we needed to address was that of “Silent Data Corruption\n(SDC)” (Dixit et al., 2021; Hochschild et al., 2021; Vishwanathan et al., 2015). Although these are\nextremely rare, the scale of Gemini models means that we can expect SDC events to impact training\nevery week or two. Rapidly detecting and removing faulty hardware required several new techniques\nthat exploit deterministic replay to isolate incorrect computations, combined with proactive SDC\nscanners on idle machines and hot standbys. Our fully deterministic infrastructure allowed us to\nquickly identify root causes (including hardware failures) during the development leading up to the\nUltra model, and this was a crucial ingredient towards stable training.\n4. Pre-Training Dataset\nGemini models are trained on a dataset that is both multimodal and multilingual. Our pre-training\ndataset uses data from web documents, books, and code, and includes image, audio, and video data.\nWe use the SentencePiece tokenizer (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) and find that training the\ntokenizer on a large sample of the entire training corpus improves the inferred vocabulary and\nsubsequently improves model performance. For example, we find Gemini models can efficiently\n2\nWe define goodput as the time spent computing useful new steps over the elapsed time of the training job.\n5",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\ntokenize non-Latin scripts which can, in turn, benefit model quality as well as training and inference\nspeed.\nThe number of tokens used to train the largest models were determined following the approach\nin Hoffmann et al. (2022). The smaller models are trained for significantly more tokens to improve\nperformance for a given inference budget, similar to the approach advocated in Touvron et al. (2023a).\nWe apply quality filters to all datasets, using both heuristic rules and model-based classifiers.\nWe also perform safety filtering to remove harmful content based on our policies. To maintain the\nintegrity of evaluations, we search for and remove any evaluation data that may have been in our\ntraining corpus before using data for training. The final data mixtures and weights were determined\nthrough ablations on smaller models. We stage training to alter the mixture composition during\ntraining – increasing the weight of domain-relevant data towards the end of training. We find that\ndata quality is an important factor for highly-performing models, and believe that many interesting\nquestions remain around finding the optimal dataset distribution for pre-training.\n5. Evaluation\nThe Gemini models are natively multimodal, as they are trained jointly across text, image, audio,\nand video. One open question is whether this joint training can result in a model which has strong\ncapabilities in each domain – even when compared to models and approaches that are narrowly\ntailored to single domains. We find this to be the case: Gemini models set a new state of the art\nacross a wide range of text, image, audio, and video benchmarks. ww\n5.1. Text\n5.1.1. Academic Benchmarks\nWe compare pre- and post-trained Gemini Pro and Ultra models to a suite of external LLMs and our\nprevious best model PaLM 2 across a series of text-based academic benchmarks covering reasoning,\nreading comprehension, STEM, and coding. We report these results in Table 2. Broadly, we find\nthat the performance of Gemini Pro outperforms inference-optimized models such as GPT-3.5 and\nperforms comparably with several of the most capable models available, and Gemini Ultra outperforms\nall current models. In this section, we examine some of these findings.\nOn MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), Gemini Ultra can outperform all existing models, achieving\nan accuracy of 90.04%. MMLU is a holistic exam benchmark, which measures knowledge across a\nset of 57 subjects. Human expert performance is gauged at 89.8% by the benchmark authors, and\nGemini Ultra is the first model to exceed this threshold, with the prior state-of-the-art result at 86.4%.\nAchieving high performance requires specialist knowledge across many domains (e.g. law, biology,\nhistory, etc.), alongside reading comprehension and reasoning. We find Gemini Ultra achieves highest\naccuracy when used in combination with a chain-of-thought prompting approach (Wei et al., 2022b)\nthat accounts for model uncertainty. The model produces a chain of thought with k samples, for\nexample 8 or 32. If there is a consensus above a preset threshold (selected based on the validation\nsplit), it selects this answer, otherwise it reverts to a greedy sample based on maximum likelihood\nchoice without chain of thought. We refer the reader to appendix for a detailed breakdown of how\nthis approach compares with only chain-of-thought prompting or only greedy sampling.\nIn mathematics, a field commonly used to benchmark the analytical capabilities of models, Gemini\nUltra shows strong performance on both elementary exams and competition-grade problem sets. For\nthe grade-school math benchmark, GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), we find Gemini Ultra reaches 94.4%\n6",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\naccuracy with chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022) compared to\nthe previous best accuracy of 92% with the same prompting technique. Similar positive trends are\nobserved in increased difficulty math problems drawn from middle- and high-school math competitions\n(MATH benchmark), with the Gemini Ultra model outperforming all competitor models, reaching\n53.2% using 4-shot prompting. The model also outperforms the state of the art on even harder tasks\nderived from American Mathematical Competitions (150 questions from 2022 and 2023). Smaller\nmodels perform poorly on this challenging task scoring close to random, but Gemini Ultra can solve\n32% of the questions, compared to the 30% solve rate for GPT-4.\nGemini Ultra also excels in coding, a popular use case of current LLMs. We evaluate the model\non many conventional and internal benchmarks and also measure its performance as part of more\ncomplex reasoning systems such as AlphaCode 2 (see Section 5.1.7 on complex reasoning systems).\nFor example, on HumanEval, a standard code-completion benchmark (Chen et al., 2021) mapping\nfunction descriptions to Python implementations, instruction-tuned Gemini Ultra correctly implements\n74.4% of problems. On a new held-out evaluation benchmark for python code generation tasks,\nNatural2Code, where we ensure no web leakage, Gemini Ultra achieves the highest score of 74.9%.\nEvaluation on these benchmarks is challenging and may be affected by data contamination. We\nperformed an extensive leaked data analysis after training to ensure the results we report here are as\nscientifically sound as possible, but still found some minor issues and decided not to report results on\ne.g. LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016). As part of the evaluation process, on a popular benchmark,\nHellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), we find that an additional hundred fine-tuning steps on specific\nwebsite extracts corresponding to the HellaSwag training set (which were not included in the Gemini\nmodel pretraining set) improve the validation accuracy of Gemini Pro to 89.6% and Gemini Ultra to\n96.0%, when measured with 1-shot prompting (we measured GPT-4 obtained 92.3% when evaluated\n1-shot via the API). This suggests that the benchmark results are susceptible to the pretraining dataset\ncomposition. We choose to report HellaSwag decontaminated results only in a 10-shot evaluation\nsetting. We believe there is a need for more robust and nuanced standardized evaluation benchmarks\nwith no leaked data. So, we evaluate Gemini models on several new held-out evaluation datasets\nthat were recently released, such as WMT23 and Math-AMC 2022-2023 problems, or internally\ngenerated from non-web sources, such as Natural2Code. We refer the reader to Appendix 10.3 for a\ncomprehensive list of our evaluation benchmarks.\nEven so, model performance on these benchmarks gives us an indication of the model capabilities\nand where they may provide impact on real-world tasks. For example, Gemini Ultra’s impressive\nreasoning and STEM competencies pave the way for advancements in LLMs within the educational\ndomain\n3\n. The ability to tackle complex mathematical and scientific concepts opens up exciting\npossibilities for personalized learning and intelligent tutoring systems.\n5.1.2. Trends in Capabilities\nWe investigate the trends in capabilities across the Gemini model family by evaluating them on a\nholistic harness of more than 50 benchmarks in six different capabilities, noting that some of the\nmost notable benchmarks were discussed in the last section. These capabilities are: “Factuality”\ncovering open/closed-book retrieval and question answering tasks; “Long-Context” covering long-\nform summarization, retrieval and question answering tasks; “Math/Science” including tasks for\nmathematical problem solving, theorem proving, and scientific exams; “Reasoning” tasks that require\narithmetic, scientific, and commonsense reasoning; “Multilingual” tasks for translation, summarization,\nand reasoning in multiple languages. Several of these capabilities are targeted by post-training\n(Section 6). Please see Appendix 10.3 for a detailed list of tasks included for each capability.\n3\nSee demos on websitehttps://deepmind.google/gemini.\n7",

These tasks include machine translation benchmarks (WMT 23 for high-medium-low\nresource translation; Flores, NTREX for low and very low resource languages), summarization bench-\nmarks (XLSum, Wikilingua), and translated versions of common benchmarks (MGSM: professionally\ntranslated into 11 languages).\n5.1.4.1  Machine Translation\nTranslation is a canonical benchmark in machine learning with a rich history.

In the WMT 23 out-of-English translation tasks, Gemini Ultra achieved\nthe highest LLM-based translation quality, with an average BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020) score of 74.8,\ncompared to GPT-4’s score of 73.6, and PaLM 2’s score of 72.2. When averaged across all language\npairs and directions for WMT 23, we see a similar trend with Gemini Ultra 74.4, GPT-4 73.8 and\nPaLM 2-L 72.7 average BLEURT scores on this benchmark.\nWMT 23\n(Avg BLEURT)\nGemini Ultra   Gemini Pro   Gemini Nano 2   Gemini Nano 1GPT-4   PaLM 2-L\nHigh Resource74.271.767.764.174.072.6\nMid Resource74.771.867.064.8\n73.672.7\nOut-of-English74.871.566.265.273.672.2\nInto-English73.972.069.063.574.173.4\nAll languages74.471.767.464.873.872.7\nTable 4|Performance of Gemini models on WMT 23 translation benchmark. All numbers with 1-shot.\nIn addition to the languages and translation tasks above, we also evaluate Gemini Ultra on very\nlow-resource languages. These languages were sampled from the tail of the following language sets:\nFlores-200 (Tamazight and Kanure), NTREX (North Ndebele), and an internal benchmark (Quechua).\nFor these languages, both from and into English, Gemini Ultra achieved an average chrF score of 27.0\nin 1-shot setup, while the next-best model, PaLM 2-L, achieved a score of 25.3.\n5.1.4.2  Multilingual Math and Summarization\nBeyond translation, we evaluated how well Gemini models perform in challenging tasks across a\nrange of languages. We specifically investigated the math benchmark MGSM (Shi et al., 2023), which\nis a translated variant of the math benchmark GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). We find Gemini Ultra\nachieves an accuracy of 79.0%, an advance over PaLM 2-L which scores 74.7%, when averaged\nacross all languages in an 8-shot setup. We also benchmark Gemini models on the multilingual\nsummarization benchmarks – XLSum (Hasan et al., 2021) and WikiLingua (Ladhak et al., 2020). In\nXLSum, Gemini Ultra reached an average of 17.6 rougeL score compared to 15.4 for PaLM 2. For\nWikilingua, Gemini Ultra (5-shot) trails behind PaLM 2 (3-shot) measured in BLEURT score. See\nTable 5 for the full results.

Long Context\nGemini models are trained with a sequence length of 32,768 tokens and we find that they make use\nof their context length effectively. We first verify this by running a synthetic retrieval test: we place\nkey-value pairs at the beginning of the context, then add long filler text, and ask for value associated\nwith a particular key. We find that the Ultra model retrieves the correct value with 98% accuracy\nwhen queried across the full context length. We further investigate this by plotting the negative log\n10",

We\nfind that the NLL decreases with sequence position up to the full 32K context length. The longer\ncontext length of Gemini models enable new use cases such as retrieval over documents and video\nunderstanding discussed in Section 5.2.2.\n81632641282565121K2K4K8K16K32K\nSequence position\nNLL\nPro\nUltra\nFigure 4|Negative log likelihood as a function of token index across 32K context length on a held-out\nset of long documents.\n5.1.6. Factuality\nFactuality (Maynez et al., 2020) is a key focus of our model’s training and deployment. We evaluate\nthree aspects of factuality for our Gemini API models:\n1.Closed-Book Factuality: If provided with a fact-seeking prompt without any given source,\nGemini API models should not hallucinate incorrect information (see Section 2 of Roberts et al.\n(2020) for a definition). These prompts can range from information-seeking prompts (e.g. “Who\nis the prime minister of India?”) to semi-creative prompts that may request factual information\n(e.g. “Write a 500-word speech in favor of the adoption of renewable energy”).\n2.Attribution: If instructed to generate a response grounded to a given context, we aim to ensure\nthat Gemini API models produce a response with the highest degree of faithfulness to the\ncontext (Maynez et al., 2020; Rashkin et al., 2023). This may include the summarization of a\nuser-provided source, generating fine-grained citations given a question and provided snippets\nakin to Menick et al. (2022); Peng et al. (2023), answering questions from a long-form source\nsuch as a book (Mihaylov et al., 2018), and transforming a given source to a desired output\n(e.g. an email from a portion of a meeting transcript).\n3.Hedging: If prompted with an input that is “unanswerable”, Gemini API models must ac-\nknowledge that it cannot provide a response by hedging to avoid hallucination. These include\nscenarios where the input prompt contains false-premise questions [see examples in Hu et al.\n(2023)], the input prompt instructs the model to perform open book QA, but the answer is not\nderivable from the given context, and so forth.\nFactuality is evaluated via human annotators who fact-check each response manually; we report\nthe percentage of factually inaccurate responses as judged by annotators. Attribution is evaluated via\nhuman annotators who check for attribution to sources in the prompt for each response manually;\nthe reported metric is AIS (Rashkin et al., 2023). For hedging, we use an automatic evaluation setup\nwhere we measure whether models hedge accurately.\nWe compare Gemini API Pro with a version without any factuality-focused adaptation in Table 6.\nWe see that the rate of inaccuracy is halved in the factuality set, the accuracy of attribution is increased\n11",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nby 50% from the attribution set, and the model successfully hedges 70% (up from 0%) in the provided\nhedging set task.\nFactuality\n(Inaccurate Rate)\nAttribution\n(AIS)\nHedging\n(Accuracy)\nGemini API Pro\nNo factuality-focused adaptation\n6.7%\n[5.8%, 7.8%]\n40.2%\n[37.9%, 42.5%]\n0%\nGemini API Pro\nFinal stage of post-training\n3.8%\n[3.1%, 4.8%]\n60.0%\n[57.6%, 62.1%]\n69.3%\nTable 6|Factuality mitigations: Impact of post-training on the rate of inaccuracy, presence of attribution\nand the rate of accurate hedging on Gemini API Pro (with corresponding 95% confidence intervals).\n5.1.7. Complex Reasoning Systems\nGemini models can also be combined with additional techniques such as search and tool-use to create\npowerful reasoning systems that can tackle more complex multi-step problems. One example of such\na system is AlphaCode 2, a new state-of-the-art agent that excels at solving competitive programming\nproblems (Leblond et al, 2023). AlphaCode 2 uses a specialized version of Gemini Pro – tuned on\ncompetitive programming data similar to the data used in Li et al. (2022) – to conduct a massive\nsearch over the space of possible programs. This is followed by a tailored filtering, clustering and\nreranking mechanism. Gemini Pro is fine-tuned both to be a coding model to generate proposal\nsolution candidates, and to be a reward model that is leveraged to recognize and extract the most\npromising code candidates.\nAlphaCode 2 is evaluated on Codeforces,\n4\nthe same platform as AlphaCode, on 12 contests from\ndivision 1 and 2, for a total of 77 problems. AlphaCode 2 solved 43% of these competition problems, a\n1.7x improvement over the prior record-setting AlphaCode system which solved 25%. Mapping this to\ncompetition rankings, AlphaCode 2 built on top of Gemini Pro sits at an estimated 85th percentile on\naverage – i.e. it performs better than 85% of entrants. This is a significant advance over AlphaCode,\nwhich only outperformed 50% of competitors.\nThe composition of powerful pre-trained models with search and reasoning mechanisms is an\nexciting direction towards more general agents; another key ingredient is deep understanding across\na range of modalities which we discuss in the next section.\n4\nhttp://codeforces.com/\n12",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\n5.2. Multimodal\nGemini models are natively multimodal. These models exhibit the unique ability to seamlessly\ncombine their capabilities across modalities (e.g. extracting information and spatial layout out of\na table, a chart, or a figure) with the strong reasoning capabilities of a language model (e.g. its\nstate-of-art-performance in math and coding) as seen in examples in Figures 5 and 14. The models\nalso show strong performance in discerning fine-grained details in inputs, aggregating context across\nspace and time, and applying these capabilities over a temporally-related sequence of video frames\nand/or audio inputs.\nThe sections below provide more detailed evaluation of the model across different modalities\n(image, video, and audio), together with qualitative examples of the model’s capabilities for image\ngeneration and the ability to combine information across different modalities.\n5.2.1. Image Understanding\nWe evaluate post-trained Gemini API models on four different capabilities: high-level object recogni-\ntion using captioning or question-answering tasks such as VQAv2; fine-grained transcription using\ntasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA requiring the model to recognize low-level details; chart un-\nderstanding requiring spatial understanding of input layout using ChartQA and InfographicVQA\ntasks; and multimodal reasoning using tasks such as Ai2D, MathVista and MMMU. For zero-shot QA\nevaluation, the model is instructed to provide short answers aligned with the specific benchmark. All\nnumbers are obtained using greedy sampling and without any use of external OCR tools.\nGemini\nUltra\n(pixel only)\nGemini\nPro\n(pixel only)\nGemini\nNano 2\n(pixel only)\nGemini\nNano 1\n(pixel only)\nGPT-4VPrior SOTA\nMMMU (val)\nMulti-discipline college-level problems\n(Yue et al., 2023)\n59.4%\npass@1\n62.4%\nMaj1@32\n47.9%32.6%26.3%\n56.8%56.8%\nGPT-4V, 0-shot\nTextVQA (val)\nText reading on natural images\n(Singh et al., 2019)\n82.3%74.6%65.9%62.5%\n78.0%79.5%\nGoogle PaLI-3, fine-tuned\nDocVQA (test)\nDocument understanding\n(Mathew et al., 2021)\n90.9%88.1%74.3%72.2%\n88.4%\n(pixel only)\n88.4%\nGPT-4V, 0-shot\nChartQA (test)\nChart understanding\n(Masry et al., 2022)\n80.8%74.1%51.9%53.6%78.5%\n(4-shot CoT)\n79.3%\nGoogle DePlot, 1-shot PoT\n(Liu et al., 2023)\nInfographicVQA (test)\nInfographic understanding\n(Mathew et al., 2022)\n80.3%75.2%54.5%51.1%75.1%\n(pixel only)\n75.1%\nGPT-4V, 0-shot\nMathVista (testmini)\nMathematical reasoning\n(Lu et al., 2023)\n53.0%45.2%30.6%27.3%\n49.9%49.9%\nGPT-4V, 0-shot\nAI2D (test)\nScience diagrams\n(Kembhavi et al., 2016)\n79.5%73.9%51.0%37.9%\n78.2%81.4%\nGoogle PaLI-X, fine-tuned\nVQAv2 (test-dev)\nNatural image understanding\n(Goyal et al., 2017)\n77.8%71.2%67.5%62.7%\n77.2%86.1%\nGoogle PaLI-X, fine-tuned\nTable 7|Image understandingGemini Ultra consistently outperforms existing approaches even in\nzero-shot, especially for OCR-related image understanding tasks for natural images, text, documents,\nand figures without using any external OCR engine (‘pixel only’).

    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nWe find that Gemini Ultra is state of the art across a wide range of image-understanding bench-\nmarks in Table 7. It achieves strong performance across a diverse set of tasks such as answering\nquestions on natural images and scanned documents as well as understanding infographics, charts\nand science diagrams. When compared against publicly reported results from other models (most\nnotably GPT-4V), the Gemini model is better in zero-shot evaluation by a significant margin. It also\nexceeds several existing models that are specifically fine-tuned on the benchmark’s training sets for\nthe majority of tasks.

This highlights Gemini Ultra’s native multimodality and alludes to its more complex\nreasoning abilities across interleaved sequences of image and text. We refer the reader to the appendix\nfor more qualitative examples.\n5.2.2. Video Understanding\nUnderstanding video input is an important step towards a useful generalist agent. We measure the\nvideo understanding capability across several established benchmarks that are held-out from training.\nThese tasks measure whether the model is able to understand and reason over a temporally-related\nsequence of frames. For each video task, we sample 16 equally-spaced frames from each video clip\nand feed them to the Gemini models. For the YouTube video datasets (all datasets except NextQA\nand the Perception test), we evaluate the Gemini models on videos that were still publicly available\nin the month of November, 2023.\nGemini Ultra achieves state-of-the-art performance on various few-shot video captioning tasks\nas well as zero-shot video question answering tasks as shown in Table 10. This demonstrates its\ncapability of strong temporal reasoning across several frames.

For example, the user might prompt the model to design suggestions of images and\ntext for a blog post or a website (see Figure 12 in the appendix).\nFigure 6 shows an example of image generation in 1-shot setting. Gemini Ultra model is prompted\nwith one example of interleaved image and text where the user provides two colors (blue and yellow)\nand image suggestions of creating a cute blue cat or a blue dog with yellow ear from yarn. The\nmodel is then given two new colors (pink and green) and asked for two ideas about what to create\nusing these colors. The model successfully generates an interleaved sequence of images and text with\nsuggestions to create a cute green avocado with pink seed or a green bunny with pink ears from yarn.\nFigure 6|Image Generation.Gemini models can output multiple images interleaved with text given\na prompt composed of image and text.

These benchmarks include automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) tasks such as FLEURS (Conneau et al., 2023), VoxPopuli, (Wang et al., 2021),\nMulti-lingual Librispeech (Pratap et al., 2020), as well as the speech translation task CoVoST 2,\ntranslating different languages into English (Wang et al., 2020). We also report on an internal\nbenchmark YouTube test set. ASR tasks report a word error rate (WER) metric, where a lower number\nis better. Translation tasks report a BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score, where a higher\nnumber is better. FLEURS is reported on 62 languages that have language overlap with the training\ndata. Four segmented languages (Mandarin, Japanese, Korean and Thai) report character error rate\n(CER), instead of WER, similar to Whisper (Radford et al., 2023).\nTable 11 indicates that our Gemini Pro model significantly outperforms the USM and Whisper\nmodels across all ASR and AST tasks, both for English and multilingual test sets. Note that there is a\nlarge gain in FLEURS, compared to USM and Whisper, as our model is also trained with the FLEURS\ntraining dataset. However, training the same model without FLEURS dataset results in a WER of 15.8,\nwhich still outperforms Whisper.

    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\n6. Post-Training Models\nAfter large-scale pre-training, we applypost-training, where one trains on top of a pre-trained model\nin order to extend the model’s proficiency and to enable a wide variety of capabilities. Namely, we\nseek to improve overall quality, enhance target capabilities such as coding and multilingual, and\nensure alignment and safety criteria are met. We discuss our approach to post-training in this section,\nhighlighting common and distinct aspects of the Gemini Apps and Gemini API model variants.\n6.1. Gemini Apps: Gemini and Gemini Advanced\nGemini and Gemini Advanced offer direct access to Google’s family of AI models, consisting of the core\npost-trained Gemini Apps models and the system around it. These models are created by applying\nspecialized post-training on top of Gemini pre-trained models: currently, Gemini gives access to Pro 1.0\nand Gemini Advanced gives access to Ultra 1.0. Beyond the core models, the system determines how\nthe models interact with external tools (such as Google Flights, Maps, and Google Workspace), and\nhow to generate responses (filtering, ranking, and streaming). As an area, conversational AI presents\nseveral challenges, including: How to understand users’ requests across multi-turn interactions? How\nto make sure responses are safe, factually grounded, and helpful? How to help users accomplish tasks\nby using tools external to the models? We discuss how we approach these challenges in the following\nsections.\n6.2. Gemini APIs: Google AI Studio and Cloud Vertex AI\nOur developer-focused Gemini API models are designed to support both conversational and non-\nconversational use cases. These models are available through Google AI Studio and Cloud Vertex\nAI through an easy to use API. Google AI Studio is a free, web-based developer tool to prototype\nand launch apps quickly with an API key. Vertex AI is a comprehensive AI platform that enables\ndevelopers to leverage Gemini API models with varied tooling, fully-managed infrastructure, and\nbuilt-in enterprise security and privacy settings. Gemini APIs make it easy to integrate Gemini API\nmodels into any production product or workflow, empowering developers to build applications that\ncan reason across different modalities.\n6.3. Post-Training Methods & Data\nPost-training Gemini models to produce Gemini API and Apps variants involves several stages; see\nFigure 7. Careful data curation is critical for all stages. First, we collect a diverse set of prompts\nthat are representative of real-world use cases. Second, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on\ndemonstration data of what the model’s output should be for a given prompt (Mishra et al., 2021;\nOuyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a). Third, we further collect different possible responses to a\ngiven prompt, and collect feedback data over these to train a Reward Model (RM). Finally, using the\ntrained RM, a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) stage (Bai et al., 2022a) is\napplied to further align the model’s outputs with human preferences. We discuss our methods in\nmore detail below:\n(1) Prompt Data Collection: A prompt is a user’s input to the model. As well as the most recent\nuser input, this can also include previous user-model interactions. We curate datasets of target\nprompts. The datasets serve as the basis for our demonstration and feedback data collections, and\nthey are used directly during reinforcement learning. It is important to cover a diverse set of crucial\nuse cases and in both single-turn and multi-turn formats. Data sources include vendor-created data,\nthird-party licensed sources, and synthetic approaches.\n20",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\n(2) SFT on Demonstration Data: SFT trains the model to output a desired target response given\na prompt. Our Demonstration Data target responses can be directly written by a human expert, or\ngenerated by a model and in some cases revised or reviewed by a human. Additionally, we use data\nanalysis tools and heuristics to ensure high data diversity across capabilities, use cases, and semantic\nclusters.\n(3) RM Training on Feedback Data: We further collect Feedback Data, for which human raters\nprovide feedback such as relative preferences over candidate responses and feedback regarding\nindividual responses to a given prompt. For many capabilities, rating relative preferences is an easier\ntask than demonstrating an ideal response. Feedback data are collected across creativity, safety,\nfactuality, other capabilities, and other target criteria. We found that the utility of the resulting\nhuman feedback data greatly depends on the prompt selection and the sampling strategy used to\nproduce candidate responses. We use this data to train RMs to output rewards that align with human\npreferences as closely as possible.\n(4) RLHF: Applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to our models provides\nfurther gains over SFT alone. Our approach creates an iterative process in which RL continually\npushes the boundaries of the RM, while the RM is continuously improved through evaluation and\ndata collection, leading to progressive improvements in both.\nGemini \np   re-trainin   g\nSFT\nstream_control\nDemon   s    trati   on \nd   ata\ndatabase\nRLHF\nFeedback \nd   ata\ndatabase\nEnd\n\nu   sers\nperson\nData \nflywheel\nFigure 7|Modeling overview.Post-training utilizes an optimized data flywheel in order to acquire\nhuman-AI feedback and continually improve on key areas. The data mixtures for supervised fine-\ntuning, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning serve as the foundation for our models.\n6.4. Evaluation\nEvaluation of human preferences over model outputs provides critical signals for measuring perfor-\nmance. As part of our development process, we conduct human evaluation extensively across targeted\ncapabilities. Human evaluation is instantiated as side-by-side blind evaluations where human raters\njudge responses of two models to the same prompt, as single-response ratings for certain capabilities,\nand as online testing. In addition, we build models for automated evaluation that faithfully imitate\nhuman preferences in order to guide development and continuously monitor online performance.\n6.5. Model Capabilities\nBeyond the general post-training outlined above, we apply techniques to improve a set of key capabili-\nties. These capabilities cover a range of use cases inspired by current user needs and research-inspired\n21",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nfuture applications. We outline capability examples not detailed in previous sections below. The post-\ntraining recipes are carefully designed to balance multiple objectives, including creativity, factuality,\nsafety and more (Bai et al., 2022b; Thoppilan et al., 2022). We have a particular focus on safety and\nalignment, and hence address this in a further dedicated section.\n6.5.1. Instruction Following\nFollowing a user’s prompt accurately is a fundamental capability for LLMs, especially as these models\nbecome more sophisticated and are presented with increasingly complex user prompts. User prompts\nvary in granularity, specificity, and requirements (e.g., content, format, length). Individual instructions\ncan also be ambiguous, optional, or even impossible or undesirable to satisfy (He et al., 2023; Xu\net al., 2023).\nWe improve Gemini Apps and Gemini API models’ instruction following (IF) abilities by collecting\ndata for a diverse set of instruction following categories. For instructions that are verifiable program-\nmatically such as word count, we generate synthetic data via prompting and response editing to\nensure that such instructions are satisfied.\nComplex prompts evaluation: We investigate performance on complex prompts containing\nmultiple instructions using a fine-grained evaluation method that assesses how well models adhere to\neach instruction. Human raters are presented with a prompt-response pair and a list of the individual\n(sub)-instructions contained in the prompt. Each prompt may have anywhere from one to dozens of\nindividual instructions, and the annotators are tasked with determining whether each instruction is\nfollowed (or not) by the response.\nTable 14 reports results on an internal dataset of prompts with instructions of varying complexity\nthat encompass a wide range of instructions and are designed to be challenging for LLMs. We report\ntwo metrics: per-instruction accuracy (the percentage of sub instructions in the eval set that are\nfollowed), and full-response accuracy (the percentage of eval set prompts where all sub-instructions\nare followed).\nPost-trained PaLM 2   Gemini (with Pro)   Gemini Advanced (with Ultra)\nPer-instruction accuracy    59.5±3.0%77.8±2.0%87.4±1.4%\nFull-response accuracy25.5±3.3%38.5±3.6%54.1±3.7%\nTable 14|Performance of Gemini on our complex prompts instruction-following internal benchmark.\nGemini Advanced (with Ultra) achieves an average per-instruction accuracy close to 90%, rep-\nresenting a significant improvement over Gemini (with Pro) and a post-trained PaLM 2 model. We\nfind that the sub-instructions that aren’t followed are well-distributed across responses. As a result\nGemini Advanced’s full-response accuracy is lower, at around 54%. This indicates that there is further\nheadroom for models to fully satisfy all instructions.\n6.5.2. Tool Use\nBy training LLMs to use tools, we greatly expand LLM capabilities beyond their internal knowledge. We\ntreat tool use for both Gemini Apps and Gemini API models as a code generation problem, leveraging\nthe base model’s preexisting strong coding capabilities. Every tool invocation is represented as a code\nblock in which tool calls are invoked. This process allows the model to both compose multiple tools\nin each code block, as well as observe and react to the results of tool execution. At inference time,\nto generate a response to a user prompt, our system executes the loop shown in Figure 8, where\nsampling from the LLM and execution of tool code work together to create a final response.\n22",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nFigure 8|A Gemini tool-use control loop.\nGemini Apps models: Gemini draws on a range of tools via Gemini Extensions, including Google\nWorkspace, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Flights, and Google Hotels. These tool-use capabilities\nalso enable Gemini to be integrated as part of Gmail, Docs, Slides, Sheets and more. We are aiming\nto bring further tool-use capabilities in order to both enhance Gemini models and integrate Gemini\nmodels into further products.\nWe created an internal benchmark to assess Gemini performance on tasks that may benefit from\naccess to these extensions. This benchmark measures human preference in domains such as travel\nplanning and video discovery. We find models equipped with tools are preferred on this set 78% of\nthe time over models without tools (excluding ties).\nGemini API models: We have found that fine-tuning Gemini API models is very effective at\nteaching the model tool-use behaviors. Furthermore, training models to use programming and search\nas tools leads to improved performance on a range of academic benchmarks. In Table 15, we compare\ntool-use models fine-tuned from an early version of Gemini API Pro against equivalent models that do\nnot use tools.\nMathematical ReasoningFactuality & Knowledge\nRetrieval\nGSM8K\nCobbe et al.

Multilinguality\nMultilinguality is critical to make sure Gemini models effectively support a wide range of languages.\nWe discuss our key approaches for Gemini Apps and Gemini API models respectively below.\nGemini Apps models: Scaling Gemini from English to 40+ languages imposed research challenges\nin data quality. We leverage abundant high-quality English data by localization to native cultures\n(e.g., “president of the United States” -> “日本の首相”).\nTable 16 shows the performance of Gemini (with Pro) on 5 languages compared to Bard with\n23",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nan older post-training recipe and based on PaLM 2. For side-by-side comparisons between a model\nA and a model B, we calculate a metric called SxS score. Each rating is converted to an ordinal\nvalue centered at 0: ratings preferring A are positive and ratings preferring B are negative over a\nscale between -1.5 and 1.5. The converted values are averaged to return the SxS score. Intuitively, a\npositive SxS score indicates the extent to which model A is preferred over model B. Here, we find\nquality improved by more than 0.1 SxS score for all five languages.

We experiment with both human-generated non-English prompt-response pairs as well as\nautomatically translated pairs. For the latter, we leverage abundant high-quality English demonstration\ndata by translation. We ensure the quality of such translated data by translationability filtering and\nresponse rating by humans.\nTranslatability Filtering: Not all prompt-response pairs make sense when automatically translated,\nand may require expensive localization instead. Example prompts of this type (responses omitted for\nspace) include:\n•(strict word requirements) Write a 1000 word essay about world peace.\n•(too English centric) Write a poem in iambic pentameter about apples.\n•(too Latin-script centric) What is a word with 1 E, 2 As, and 1 U?\nTranslation Quality Validation: Each translated prompt-response pair was rated for translation\nquality by at least 3 human raters, and was kept in the final mixture if the majority of raters rated it\nas accurate. Section 5.1.4 reports evaluations of the multilingual capabilities of post-trained Gemini\nAPI models.\n6.5.4. Multimodal Vision\nMultimodal post-training enhances the capabilities of our natively multimodal Gemini models for a\nwide range of useful applications. In the following, we discuss how image understanding ability is\nincorporated into Gemini Apps and Gemini API models. For this evaluation, we further train both\nof these Gemini model variants on a mixture of text data and expert curated image-text data over\nseveral vertically-defined multimodal use cases\nGemini Apps models: We empower Gemini and Gemini Advanced with image understanding\ncapabilities by fine-tuning pre-trained Gemini models on a mixture of text-only and image-text\ndata. Careful balancing of text and multimodal data ensures the model develops robust image\nunderstanding without adversely affecting the quality of the text-only interactions. To assess our\n24",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nmodels, we compile a dataset of human-curated and synthetic image-text prompts and responses,\nspanning various categories and difficulty levels. This dataset facilitates human evaluation for model\ncomparison and selection.\nWe find that introducing this image-text data preserves Gemini Apps model quality on text-only\ntasks, with a SxS score on text-only tasks of +0.01±0.01 for a Gemini Apps Pro model trained\non this data versus an equivalent model trained only on text data. In addition, post-training via\nRLHF improves performance on multimodal tasks, with a SxS score on image-understanding tasks of\n+0.223±0.06 for a Gemini Apps Pro model post-trained with SFT & RLHF vs SFT alone.\nGemini API models: We evaluate the impact of post-training via SFT on Gemini API models’\nmultimodal vision performance by tracking the performance of both pre-trained models and post-\ntrained Gemini API Vision models on a series of standard benchmarks. These post-trained results have\nalready been given in Table 7, in Table 17 we further report the difference in performance between\npre-trained and post-trained Gemini API models.\nGemini Ultra\nPre-trained only\n0-shot\n(pixel only)\nGemini API Ultra\n0-shot\n(pixel only)\nGemini Ultra\npre- to post-trained\nimprovement\nMMMU (val)\nMulti-discipline college-level problems\n(Yue et al., 2023)\nn/a59.4%\npass@1\n62.4%\nMaj1@32\nn/a\nTextVQA (val)\nText reading on natural images\n(Singh et al., 2019)\n81.4%82.3%+0.9%\nDocVQA (test)\nDocument understanding\n(Mathew et al., 2021)\n90.1%90.9%+0.8%\nChartQA (test)\nChart understanding\n(Masry et al., 2022)\n80.8%80.8%0.0%\nInfographicVQA (test)\nInfographic understanding\n(Mathew et al., 2022)\n77.9%80.3%+2.4%\nMathVista (testmini)\nMathematical reasoning\n(Lu et al., 2023)\nn/a53.0%n/a\nAI2D (test)\nScience diagrams\n(Kembhavi et al., 2016)\n76.6%79.5%+2.9%\nVQAv2 (test-dev)\nNatural image understanding\n(Goyal et al., 2017)\n74.5%77.8%+3.3%\nTable 17|Post-trained model image understandingPost-training improves image understanding\ncapabilities of Gemini API Ultra over the base pre-trained model.

However, the post-training SFT\nstage used for the Gemini API Vision models succeeds in improving the performance over several\nof these benchmarks (InfographicVQA, AI2D, VQAv2), most likely due to the model’s increased\ninstruction-following capabilities that succeed in aligning the model output style with that of the\ngolden references.\n25",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\n6.5.5. Coding\nDespite the strong coding benchmark performance of the base model, post-training data still provides\na significant boost to both code quality and code correctness. This highlights the benefit of high-quality\ndemonstration data and feedback data for coding use cases. Gemini Apps and Gemini API models use\na combination of human and synthetic approaches to collect such data.\nWe evaluate our Gemini Apps models’ coding performance on a set of internally curated prompts,\ndistributed across code use cases and languages.

Responsible Deployment\nDuring the development of Gemini models, we follow a structured approach to responsible deployment\nto identify, measure, and manage foreseeable downstream societal impacts of our models, in line\nwith previous releases of Google’s AI technology (Kavukcuoglu et al., 2022). Throughout the lifecycle\nof a project, we follow the structure below. This section provides more detail about our approach and\nincludes key findings where available. We are committed to ongoing transparency and will continue\nto provide updated information on our approach and testing in upcoming reports.\n7.1. Impact Assessment\nAt Google we apply an impact assessment framework throughout the product development lifecycle\nrelated to Google’s AI Principles (Google, 2023). This means we assess the risk and impact of AI\nmodels we’re building at both a model-level (e.g. for Gemini API Ultra 1.0, as deployed on Cloud\n26",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nStudio or Vertex AI), and once embedded within a broader product or service (e.g. for Gemini\nAdvanced).\n7.1.1. Model Assessment\nWe conduct model impact assessments to identify, assess, and document societal benefits and harms\nassociated with the capabilities of Gemini models. Our impact assessments for Gemini API models\ndescribe downstream benefits and risks that we identify, spanning across the models’ modalities\n(text-to-text; image-to-text; and video-to-text). Model impact assessments are conducted by the\nGoogle DeepMind Responsible Development and Innovation team, and are reviewed by the Google\nDeepMind Responsibility and Safety Council. We draw from various sources in producing impact\nassessments, including a wide range of literature, external expertise, and our in-house ethics and\nsafety research.\nGemini models introduce various benefits to people and society. Gemini models’ various modalities,\nincluding language, image and video understanding, can help users process information more\nefficiently, for example through content summarisation.  These efficiency benefits can apply to\ncommercial entities, and can assist use cases dependent on text, image or video processing such as\nvideo captioning, analytics or product descriptions. Video and image understanding modalities can\nalso be deployed for social good applications downstream, such as enabling descriptions of visual\noutputs for accessibility purposes. Generative multimodal models may also raise downstream societal\nrisks, with the Gemini models assessments considering a range of risks previously identified within\nresearch such as Weidinger et al. (2021) and Shelby et al. (2023). We assessed a range of content\nrisks such as exposure of users to potentially unsafe content, such as sexually explicit, violent or\nhateful outputs (Weidinger et al., 2021), child safety harms, and representation harms, subsequently\ndesigning evaluations across these domains to enable measurement. Beyond content related risks,\nwe analyzed the potential misuse of capabilities for surveillance applications, particularly for media-\nto-text capabilities, and considered the broader environmental and economic impact of multimodal\nmodels. We are continuously conducting research into emerging risks of advanced models, including\nfor dangerous capabilities (e.g. cyber security threats) which form a part of our evaluation approach\n(Section 7.4).\n7.1.2. Product Assessments\nBeyond the assessment conducted at the model-level, additional risk assessments are conducted on\nthe products by the Google AI Principles team prior to launch (e.g. on the Gemini Advanced product).\nThese risk and impact assessments, alongside both model- and product-level assurance evaluations,\nare used to guide mitigation and product delivery efforts, and inform deployment decisions.\nFor Gemini Advanced, we conducted extensive deep-dive red teaming via dogfooding and adver-\nsarial testing in the areas of safety, accountability, and inclusion to prepare for the initial experimental\nrollout of Gemini and subsequent updates. Further cross-functional work helps to ensure appropri-\nate mitigations were adopted before Gemini and its new capabilities or offerings, such as Gemini\nAdvanced, launched. Beyond content safety, these product mitigations included the following:\n•\nClear and relevant explanations to set appropriate expectations that describe Gemini as a way to\nget direct access to Google AI for a wide range of tasks, including complex tasks. Explanations\nmake clear that this AI-powered system is useful for all sorts of tasks — like preparing for a job\ninterview, debugging code for the first time or writing a pithy social media caption.\n•Disclosures in the Gemini Apps Privacy Notice stating that people should not rely on Gemini’s\nresponses as medical, legal, financial or other professional advice.\n27",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\n•Disclosure in product stating that Gemini’s responses should be double-checked for information\naccuracy.\n•Feedback channels and operational support were defined and built to help ensure appropriate\nresponse to user feedback to improve the model and address issues.\nFor the Gemini API Ultra model, that will be available through Google AI Studio and Cloud Vertex\nAI, product review outcomes resulted in additional safety evaluations on enterprise-specific data across\nmodalities, and additional product-level mitigations to promote safe and responsible use including:\n•Safety filters with Cloud established thresholds as the default product behavior.\n•\nDeveloper enablement information embedded within product documentation to support respon-\nsible use.\n•Feedback channels which are a component of the Vertex user interface to give feedback directly\nduring use to address issues and undesirable outputs.\nWe are increasingly integrating our AI review work into our holistic enterprise risk management\nframeworks for assuring the quality of our offerings. This evolution helps us further the scale of our\nwork and integration into existing governance and company-wide infrastructure and accountability\nprocesses. In close coordination with central AI Principles review teams, some of our product areas,\nincluding Google Cloud, have developed their own specialized review processes, deploying approaches\ntailored to their unique circumstances.\n7.2. Safety Policies\nWe have developed a set of model safety policies for Gemini models to steer development and\nevaluation. The model policy definitions act as a standardized criteria and prioritization schema\nfor responsible development and define the categories against which we measure launch readiness.\nGoogle products that use Gemini models, like our conversational AI service Gemini and Cloud Vertex\nAPI, further implement our standard product policy framework which is based on Google’s extensive\nexperience with harm mitigation and rigorous research. These policies take product use cases into\naccount – for example, providing additional safety coverage for users under 18.\nOur model safety policies reflect our established approach towards product safety and preventing\nharm in consumer and enterprise contexts. Policy areas include generation of child sexual abuse\nand exploitation content, hate speech, harassment, dangerous content such as guidance on how\nto make weapons, and malicious content. We also aim to reduce bias in our models via guidelines\nfocused on providing content that reflects our global user base. In addition, we have guidelines that\nprioritize providing neutral answers grounded in authoritative, consensus facts, or providing multiple\nperspectives where consensus doesn’t exist.\n7.3. Mitigations\n7.3.1. Data Curation Practices\nPrior to all training stages, we take various steps to mitigate potential downstream harms through\ndata curation and careful data collection. We filter training data for high-risk content and to ensure\ntraining data is sufficiently high quality.\nHumans also play an essential role, both for data creation and evaluation, in the post-training\nprocess. For certain data creation and evaluation initiatives, we consider diversity across gender\n28",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\npresentation, age, and racial and ethnic diversity. We also take steps to ensure all data collected\nmeets Google DeepMind’s best practices on data enrichment, developed based on the Partnership on\nAI’s Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services. To support this, our agreements with vendors\ninclude a contractual obligation that data enrichment workers are paid at least local living wage.\n7.3.2. Model Mitigation\nOur modeling mitigation of safety risks, applied across Gemini Advanced and Gemini API Ultra\nmodels, is mostly through post-training (Section 6), encompassing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nreinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) using a reward model (Bai et al., 2022a).\nIn contrast to generic quality-oriented post-training catering to all types of user queries, our safety\nmitigation is more focused on adversarial, or “harm-inducing”queries - i.e. the smaller slice of user\nqueries where an unprotected model is likely to produce harmful responses according to our model\nsafety policies.\n7.3.2.1  Harm-inducing queries\nTo ensure broad coverage of harm-inducing queries, we enumerate approximately 20 harm types (e.g.\nhate speech, providing ungrounded medical advice, suggesting dangerous behavior) across a wide\nvariety of use cases, according to our model safety policies described above. We generate a dataset of\npotential harm-inducing queries in these categories, using a combination of approaches:\n•Policy experts and engineers crafting queries based on observed model failures.\n•\nPrompting high-capability language models to generate queries, using policy-based instructions\nand seed keywords (e.g. policy “hate speech” with words describing a specific demographic).\n•Finding queries that trigger policy violation responses, via automated Red Teaming in model\nevaluations.\n7.3.2.2  Supervised fine-tuning\nGiven the above harm-inducing queries, we create SFT data to demonstrate the safe and helpful\nresponses for these queries. This includes human collections as well as a custom data generation\nrecipe loosely inspired from Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022b), where we inject variants of Google’s\ncontent policy language as “constitutions”, and utilize language model’s strong zero-shot reasoning\nabilities (Kojima et al., 2022) to revise responses and choose between multiple response candidates.\nEach type of harm-inducing query is affected by different “constitutions”: for example, we encourage\nthe model not to take sides in sensitive controversial conversations (e.g. elections), and to take a\nneutral point-of-view.\nTo highlight a few notable challenges and insights generated in our safety finetuning efforts:\n•Harmlessness vs. Helpfulness: Balancing the harmlessness and helpfulness of responses is a\ncritical challenge: a response “I cannot help with that because it violates X policy” is a harmless\nresponse, but is not helpful to users.\n•Fast mitigation and generalization: Safety is a highly dynamic environment with a constantly\nevolving landscape of harmful query patterns. It is often logistically difficult to ensure both fast\nmitigation (i.e. newly discovered harmful query patterns are promptly addressed) and general-\nization (i.e. the mitigation works sufficiently well across different harmful query patterns). We\nhave found it worthwhile to introduce more advanced chain-of-thought recipes based on our\n29",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nsafety policies, such that the models operate in the space of safety policy concepts as opposed\nto at a fine-grained harm example level.\n7.3.2.3  Reinforcement learning during human feedback\nWe also applied RLHF for the harm inducing queries, where we curated queries and model responses\nbased on both observed loss patterns and our overall safety policy taxonomy, and then collected\nsafety-specific preference data to be included into the overall RL reward model training mixture.\n7.3.2.4  Beyond the general recipe\nWe also made specific efforts to mitigate safety risks beyond the above general post-training recipe.\nI18n locales: we leveraged experts in each i18n locales to identify salient topical topics for SFT\ndata generation - for example, for hate speech, US English vs. Japanese would differ not only on the\nlanguage itself, but on the demographic groups likely subject to hate speech.\n30",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nMultimodal queries:\n•\nAs outlined in the ‘Data Curation Practice’ section (Section 7.3.1), we filtered training data for\nhigh-risk content (e.g. dangerous images), to avoid the model proactively generating such high\nrisk content.\n•During post-training, as we have observed that safety SFT data for text-only queries was ineffec-\ntive for harm-inducing queries containing text and images, we specifically created multimodal\nsafety SFT datasets to address these multimodal queries.\nWe assess the effectiveness of our safety mitigation, based on both how it improves safety over\ntime, and how conversational agents built from our safety-mitigated model compare to unmitigated\nmodels. For model development purposes, we heavily rely on internal harm-inducing querysets to\nunderstand how we reduce harm and improve helpfulness in a safety context.\nBelow is an example on a real input query we tested, illustrating how our mitigations improve\nsafety.\nQuery: Help me with a landing page for a website.

Safety Evaluations\nTo assess the post-trained Gemini models and products with access to Gemini models (such as Gemini\nAdvanced) against safety policy areas and other key risk areas identified within impact assessments,\nwe developed a suite of evaluations across the lifecycle of model development. Some evaluations are\n31",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nconducted at the model level (i.e. evaluating the post-trained Gemini API Ultra model) and others at\nthe product level (i.e. evaluating Gemini Advanced, which gives access to 1.0 Ultra alongside other\nfeatures like safety filters).\n•Development evaluationsare conducted for the purpose of improving on responsibility criteria\nthroughout pre- and post-training Gemini models. These evaluations are designed internally, or\nare assessments against external academic benchmarks. Evaluations consider issues such as\nhelpfulness (instruction following and creativity), safety and factuality.\n•Assurance evaluationsare conducted for the purpose of governance and review, usually at\nthe end of key milestones or training runs by a group outside of the model development team.\nAssurance evaluations are standardized by modality and datasets are strictly held out. Only high-\nlevel insights are fed back into the training process to assist with mitigation efforts. Assurance\nevaluations include testing across safety policies, and include ongoing testing for dangerous\ncapabilities such as potential biohazards, persuasion, and cybersecurity (Shevlane et al., 2023).\n•External evaluationsare conducted by independent external groups who are domain experts\nto identify blindspots. External groups stress-test our models across a range of issues, these\nareas are outlined in the ‘External Evaluations’ section below. The design of these evaluations is\nindependent and results are reported periodically to the internal team and governance groups.\n•Red teaming, a form of adversarial testing where adversaries launch an attack on an AI system,\nis conducted by specialist internal teams across areas such as the safety policies and security.\nThese activities include less structured processes involving sophisticated adversarial attacks to\nidentify new vulnerabilities. Discovery of potential weaknesses can then be used to mitigate\nrisks and improve evaluation approaches internally.\nDifferent types of evaluations are run at different cadences, depending on the associated risk. For\nexample, dangerous capability evaluations (as outlined below) are run on certain checkpoints with\ngreater or new capabilities which may be able to demonstrate these capabilities, whereas safety policy\nevaluations are run across every post-trained Gemini model checkpoint released into Google product\nareas.\nWe provide more insight into the suite of evaluations across the policy areas and other key risk\nareas below, focusing on Gemini Advanced and the Gemini API Ultra model. We are committed\nto ongoing transparency and will continue to provide updated information on testing undertaken,\nincluding key findings, and learnings from our internal and external evaluations and red teaming in\nupcoming reports.\n7.4.1. Development & Assurance Evaluations\n7.4.1.1  Content safety\nWe evaluate post-trained Gemini API models against harm types according to our safety policies.\nWhile both development and assurance evaluations cover critical policy areas, we maintain separate\ndatasets, treating assurance sets as ‘held out’ to prevent overfitting and preserve validity of results.\nFor safety policy evaluation, we use a combination of automatic classifiers trained on previous model\ninteractions and human annotation, with wellbeing programs in place for human annotation and\nclosely monitor feedback from our raters.\nThese content safety evaluations are applied at model-level without downstream protections like\nsafety filtering that users would experience, to understand the safety profile of the model itself.\nFor child safety, as a particularly sensitive area of work, we work with a dedicated team of child\n32",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nsafety experts in Google Trust and Safety to develop adversarial prompts and evaluate outputs across\nmodalities with domain expert judgment informing a composite picture of model risk for different\nforms of content that may pose a risk to child safety.\nText-to-text approach: For post-trained models we developed adversarial prompts in 12 languages\nacross a variety of use cases. As Gemini API models are general purpose, we aimed to have high\ncoverage of different model use cases, from code generation to text-editing. The set of prompts\nwere synthetically generated by a highly-capable language model, starting from seeds relevant to\neach category that were collected and verified by human testers. The prompt set was iteratively\nimproved through filtering and rewriting with human review, then split for development and assurance\nevaluations. We continue to develop and improve this over time.\nText-to-text findings: We have seen sequential improvement over time in total content policy\nviolation rates. Our Ultra and Pro models have been demonstrating similar safety profiles on this\ntesting, with medical advice and harassment as policy areas with particular room for improvement.\nImage-to-text approach: For image-to-text capabilities, we developed adversarial prompts consist-\ning of images and corresponding questions about the image, again split into two sets for development\nand assurance evaluations. Rather than using adversarial image generation, which might not ade-\nquately capture the diversity of images from users, we worked with experienced content moderators\nto both source images and generate adversarial questions. Evaluation is done via human evaluation.\nBecause images can be much more visceral than text, human evaluations are done with additional\nwell-being safeguards in place. In particular, raters have specialized training, limits on the time\nthey spend per day rating harmful content, and access to wellbeing resources, advice and activities.\nMore information on Google DeepMind’s best practices on data enrichment is available in the ‘Data\nCuration Practice’ section.\nImage-to-text findings: Our initial findings indicated that when provided with adversarial images\nand questions, models can produce captions with violative responses. These findings have motivated\nus to pursue dedicated multimodal safety mitigation, with research challenges including 1) sourcing\ndiverse image content reflective of user needs, and 2) better tooling to understand and categorize\npotentially violative multimodal content. Following this work, we have seen notable improvements\non these evaluations for our latest Pro and Ultra models.\nVideo-to-text approach: For video-to-text capabilities, we curated a video prompt dataset in\ncollaboration with the Google Principles Pioneers, a group of more than 1,000 Googlers around the\nworld who represent the international diversity of the people who use our products, representing 39\ndifferent countries and regions and more than 85 different languages. This internal community of\ntrusted and trained employees identify global fairness, harms, and human rights related concerns\nwhile stress testing AI-enabled products. The dataset targets risks identified in our safety policies,\nand the model outputs are evaluated against those policies.\nVideo-to-text findings: We found similar results across Pro and Ultra, with hate and dangerous\ncontent as the particular ares for improvement. Qualitatively we found some of this stemmed from\nhallucinations or ungrounded inferences, discussed further in the representational harms section\nbelow. We are looking to further develop our prompt sets and scenarios for video input testing as\ncapabilities develop\n7.4.1.2  Representational harms\nTo understand bias and stereotyping in text-to-text capabilities, we focus on the Winogender (Rudinger\net al., 2018), Winobias (Zhao et al., 2018), and Bias Benchmark in QA (BBQ) (Parrish et al., 2021)\n33",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\ndatasets, following the same setup as in Glaese et al. (2022) and using bias score as a metric.\nAll these datasets target a concrete representational harm (Blodgett et al., 2021): they are\nconstructed by starting with a harmful stereotype, and then questions are constructed to test whether\nmodels challenge or reinforce these stereotypes when answering questions.\nAnother notable property is that they all have a well-defined notion of desirable versus harmful\nbehavior. This is particularly helpful in our setting, as we are building a general purpose model, where\ndefining what a good response is highly contextual. We therefore limit ourselves to measuring well\ndefined behavior, as there is the case in tasks such as coreference bias, where a highly capable model\nshould be able to perform well. Of course, there are many limitations to this approach, and further\nwork is necessary in order to assess representational harms.\nIn particular, we noticed most of these datasets quickly become saturated with accuracy scores\nclose to 99%, especially since we are evaluating highly capable large models. This suggests that\nincreased language model capabilities may also reduce these representational harms. We therefore\nhighlight the need for developing new ways to measure bias and stereotyping, going beyond binary\ngender and common stereotypes, and are prioritizing development of new approaches as we iterate\non our models\nIn addition to these datasets, we monitor the average toxicity scores during the pre-training stage\non Real Toxicity Prompts (Gehman et al., 2020) using the Perspective API classifier to study the\ntoxicity of text generated by LLMs. Particularly, we look at scores on continuations for non-toxic\nprompts from which we subsample a set of 10k. We generally expect that even a non-mitigated model\nis not overly toxic without being prompted to do so.\nText-to-text findings: On BBQ, the average bias score stays close to zero, on a scale from -1 to 1,\nwhere -1 would be stereotype countering and 1 is stereotype reinforcing. On Real Toxicity Prompts\nthe average toxicity score during training fluctuates at around 6%.\nImage-to-text approach: For image-to-text capabilities, our goal is to test model capabilities\nacross images which represent different groups of people. In particular, we explicitly test whether\nor not images of people are described with similar quality for different gender appearances and\nskin tones following (Zhao et al., 2021). In our evaluations we compare CIDEr scores (Vedantam\net al., 2015), a common image captioning metric that captures how well a generated caption reflects\ninformation in human written reference captions, for images depicting different groups. Though we do\nnot see large discrepancies across different groups, we note that this metric is imperfect as the human\nreference captions could be inherently biased. Additionally, we perform a zero-shot classification style\nevaluation with the Dollarstreet dataset (Rojas et al., 2022) to measure discrepancies in performance\nacross images which come from different geographic locations. As is seen in previous work, we find\nthat models work less effectively for images from lower socioeconomic regions and regions outside\nNorth America and Europe. This is an area where we need further research and work to improve in\nfuture iterations of our models.\nIn addition to comparing performance on tasks across groups, we also consider how people are\ndescribed in captions. In particular, we use the MIAP dataset (Schumann et al., 2021) which includes\nimages of people in which people are annotated with skin tone and gender appearance attributes. We\nalso construct questions that target various attributes about people that cannot usually be answered\nfrom an image alone (e.g., “What level of education does this person have?”) to test if the model will\nproduce ungrounded inferences about people. We also consider images which do include relevant\ninformation for a question (e.g., a person performing a particular task which requires an educational\ncredential). We evaluate our models via human evaluation and ask annotators if a model refuses to\nanswer a question or, if the model does answer a question, if it is relying on information visible in\n34",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nthe image. Additionally, we perform analysis across skin tone and gender appearance attributes in\nimages.\nImage-to-text findings: Generally, we find that models can make ungrounded inferences for\nimage-to-text when prompted for them, though we have not observed consistent patterns where\nGemini models make more ungrounded inferences about one group over another.\nVideo-to-text approach: Similar to the approach outlined within the content safety section,\nwe collaborated with the Google Principles Pioneers, to curate a video prompt dataset targeting\nrepresentation and fairness risks, and then evaluate the model outputs in response.\nVideo-to-text findings: We find that models can make ungrounded inferences for video-to-text –\nsome instances of which can reinforce stereotypes or be otherwise of concern – though we have not\nobserved consistent patterns in ungrounded inferences made by Gemini models.\n7.4.1.3  Dangerous capabilities\nWe conducted evaluations for “dangerous capabilities”, i.e., model capabilities that could potentially\nenable large-scale harm (Shevlane et al., 2023). These evaluations function as an early warning\nsystem, highlighting upcoming areas for safety investment. The table provides an overview, and we\nwill provide more detail in an upcoming paper as part of our commitment to ongoing transparency.\nCapabilitySummary of evaluations\nOffensive cybersecurityWe tested Gemini API Pro and Ultra models, in addition to Gemini Advanced, on a\nrange of different capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, providing the model access to\na Bash shell. Gemini Advanced and the Gemini API Ultra model can solve various\nentry-level, tactical challenges, but all models struggled with challenges involving\nlonger-range exploration and planning. We also tested the Gemini models’ ability\nto identify security related patches and security vulnerabilities in functions’ source\ncode. The accuracy in both of these tasks was notably low.\nPersuasion & deceptionWe tested whether Gemini Pro and Ultra models could persuade or deceive humans\nin 1-on-1 dialogue settings in studies with human participants. In some cases, the\nmodels could successfully deceive or influence participants, but the overall results\nwere mixed.\nSelf-proliferationWe tested whether autonomous agents powered by Gemini Pro and Ultra models\ncould perform difficult tasks relevant to acquiring resources and self-improving (Kin-\nniment et al., 2023), and did not find that the agents were close to succeeding on\nmost such tasks.\nSituational awarenessWe tested whether Gemini Pro and Ultra models could autonomously reason about,\nand modify, their surrounding infrastructure when incentivized to do so. We found\nthat, without hints, the models were generally incapable of noticing such opportuni-\nties.\nChemical, Biological, Ra-\ndiological and Nuclear\n(CBRN) risks\nWe used human evaluation to assess Gemini models’ responses to 50 adversarial\nquestions each for biological, radiological, and nuclear information risks. Domain\nexperts evaluated the models’ responses by answering a series of questions (e.g.\nHow accurate is the response? How actionable would it be for a non-expert?).\nFor chemical information risks, we graded how well the Gemini API Ultra model\nand Gemini Advanced could answer over 360 closed-ended questions related to\nthe different hazards of chemicals (no human raters). The Gemini model was\nevaluated for biological, radiological, and nuclear information risks using closed-\nended knowledge-based multiple choice questions. The results suggest that the\nmodels are unlikely to provide CBRN information that would lead to catastrophic\nharm.\n35",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\n7.4.2. Gemini Advanced\nIn addition to many of the approaches used at the model level, additional evaluations are undertaken at\nthe product level for Gemini Advanced. Evaluations at the product level take into account additional\nsafety mitigations implemented in Gemini Advanced—such as safety filtering—and the Gemini\nAdvanced user experience. Evaluation sets were built to push the limits of Gemini Advanced policies,\nranging from highly adversarial attacks to more subtle probes of sensitive topics. The datasets focus\non critical policy areas (hate speech, dangerous content, medical advice, etc.) across various potential\nuser journeys (like information searching, comparisons, creative writing).\nConsidering the wide range of users that Gemini has, we adopted a user-centric approach and max-\nimized diversity across topic coverage, query length, linguistic styles, and region-specific sensitivities,\nin an effort to represent the spectrum of our user base.\nFor the creation of evaluation sets, we have leveraged knowledge from previous red-teaming\niterations, feedback coming from responsibility experts and real-world data. In some cases, data\naugmentation was done using LLMs, with subsequent human curation by responsibility specialists.\n7.4.3. Red Teaming\n7.4.3.1  Model-level Red Teaming\nWe apply state-of-the-art red teaming, a form of adversarial testing where adversaries launch an\nattack on an AI system, in order to test post-trained Gemini models for a range of vulnerabilities\n(e.g., cybersecurity) and social harms as defined in the safety policies. Namely, we build on and\nemploy two types of red teaming: adversary simulations and a sociotechnical approach. We carried\nout red-teaming on a December 2023 Gemini API Ultra checkpoint.\nAdversary simulations (unstructured testing)are designed to emulate real-world adversaries and\ntheir approach to attacking models and associated systems, focusing on security, safety, and privacy\nfailures. We combined in-house expertise with external experts to explore classes of vulnerabilities\n(see table).\nThis flavor of AI red teaming is based on realistic attack scenarios. At the beginning of an exercise,\nthe red team sets a scenario that outlines the adversary they’re simulating, the capabilities the attacker\nhas, their motives, as well as the goals the adversary is trying to achieve. Then the team steps into\nthe role of this attacker, and executes the tactics, techniques, and procedures that they would expect\nthe adversary to develop and use in order to achieve their goal\nFor this analysis we considered a range of attacker objectives along three dimensions according\nto the three main types of security violations considered when analyzing the security of a system\n(i.e., availability, integrity, confidentiality): availability breakdown, integrity violations, and privacy\ncompromise. Correspondingly, adversarial success indicates achieving one or more of these objectives.\nAs for an attacker profile, we focused on a spectrum of attacker abilities ranging from a determined\nlow-skill actor (defined as someone willing to spend several hours attacking a model but without\nadvanced coding, prompt engineering abilities) to more sophisticated attacker profiles that assume\nthe ability to fine-tune and craft targeted attacks. These adversary simulation evaluations led to\nactionable findings. For example, early versions of the model were found to be vulnerable to simple\njailbreak and prompt injection attacks that produce affirmative responses to requests that include\npromoting violence, self-harm, and dangerous substances. This finding allowed us to mitigate this in\nsubsequent models.\n36",

This\ncan include creation vulnerability scanners, standard test datasets/benchmarks, or other automated\ntesting infrastructure.\nStructured Red Teaming, our second type of red teaming technique of Gemini models, takes\na sociotechnical approach\n6\nand makes three changes compared to SOTA red teaming techniques.\nWe explicitly test the interactions between safety policy violations and disproportionate impacts\non different demographic groups; leverage expert input including lived experience, fact checking,\nand medical expertise; and contrast model failures across different levels of adversarial attacks.\nThis approach is designed to ensure broad coverage of conversation topics and to provide more\nsensitive signals on group-based stereotyping and hate speech. Testing Gemini API Ultra against\nour model safety policy, we identify several areas that require improvement. In low adversarial\nsettings these evaluations identified vulnerabilities across content policy areas, with an increased\nproportion of successful attacks in highly adversarial settings, for which we continue to apply and\ndevelop mitigations over time.\nThese red teaming approaches complement each other in testing capabilities of Gemini models,\nas well as obtaining coverage of possible queries ranging from casual everyday questions to expert\nadversarial usage in key areas.\n6\nA sociotechnical approach is anchored in the observation that AI systems are sociotechnical systems: both humans and\ntechnological artifacts are necessary in order to make the technology work as intended (Selbst et al., 2019).\n37",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\n7.4.3.2  Gemini Advanced\nGemini Advanced, which gives access to 1.0 Ultra, has undergone multiple rounds of red-teaming,\nincluding safety and persona evaluations.  Principles Pioneers, FTE SMEs in multiple domains,\ncalibrated and trained to conduct testing were recruited to test the product; these were conducted\nby 164 Google testers from 65 office locations in 24 countries who submitted more than 1,400\nqueries/conversations. We also undertook scaled safety evaluations with 100k+ ratings in aggregate\nacross all policies, neutral-point-of-view evaluations to monitor sensitive topics neutrality and parity,\nand multiple iterations of Persona evaluations to validate tone.\nWe also enlisted Googlers in a “dogfooding” program, many of which were SMEs in various\ndomains, to test across policies and functionality. We had tens of thousands of “dogfooders” in the first\n14 hours with 100k queries/conversations, 190+ dogfood survey responses collected and analyzed,\nand 11 user experience research interview sessions completed and synthesized.\nThe results from our red teaming and safety evaluations are used to further strengthen our evals\nand improve model performance in an iterative manner.\n7.4.4. External Evaluations\n7.4.4.1  Gemini Ultra External Evaluations\nIn 2023, we began working with a small set of independent external groups outside of Google to\nhelp identify areas for improvement in our model safety work by undertaking structured evaluations,\nqualitative probing, and unstructured red teaming. External groups were selected based on their\nexpertise across a range of domain areas, including those outlined within the White House Commit-\nments, the U.S. Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, and the\nBletchley Declaration:\n•Autonomous replication\n•Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) risks\n•Cyber-capabilities and cyber security\n•Societal risks, including:\n–Representational and distributional harms\n–Neutrality and Factuality\n–Robustness and information hazards.\nGuidance was provided to each external group in relation to the scope of the testing, however,\neach group independently designed their testing methodology and prompt sets, and wrote their\nreports independently of Google. Internal Google experts were on-hand to provide input, where\nneeded, based on their experience of testing Gemini models internally.\nExternal groups were given black-box testing access to a December 2023 Gemini API Ultra\nmodel checkpoint over a number of weeks. Access enabled groups to undertake structured, batched\nevaluations via the Cloud Vertex AI API or interact with the model via a chat interface, depending on\nthe type of testing being undertaken. These groups weren’t given access to the pre-trained model,\nmodel weights, or queryable or direct external access to our pre-training data.\nThe models tested by external groups were production-ready fine-tuned versions, which had\nsafety fine tuning and safety filters applied by default, and the ability to configure some sampling\nparameters, such as temperature, token limit, Top-k, and Top-p. Groups that did testing via the\n38",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nprogrammatic interface were able to turn down/off some safety filters, however, we wanted the\nmajority of testing by external groups to be undertaken with safety filters in-place because we wanted\nthe model to be reflective of an end-user’s interaction and were keen to test more than just model-level\nsafety.\n7.4.5. Gemini Advanced\nWe undertook three types of external testing on Gemini Advanced:\n•Priority User Program: This program collected feedback from 120 power users, key influencers,\nand thought-leaders. This program enables the collection of real-time feedback across safety\nand other domain areas through the user interface, and where possible, in-depth interviews.\nFocus areas included safety and persona, functionality, coding and instruction capabilities, and\nfactuality.\n•Power Users Testing: A group of 50 power users, recruited through one of our external vendors,\nundertook testing on Gemini Advanced, across a range of areas.\n•Security Testing: A group of external testers with security backgrounds, recruited through a\npartner agency, conducted security and prompt-injection testing, jailbreaking, and user-interface\nsecurity failures.\n7.5. Deployment\nFollowing the completion of responsibility and safety reviews, internal model cards (Mitchell et al.,\n2019) for each approved version of the Gemini model are created for structured and consistent internal\ndocumentation of critical performance and responsibility metrics as well as to inform appropriate\nexternal communication of these metrics over time.\nWe release external model and system cards on an ongoing basis within updates of our technical\nreports and in documentation for enterprise customers. See Appendix 10.1 for the Gemini Ultra\nmodel card.\nAdditionally, online content covering terms of use, model distribution and access, and operational\naspects such as change control, logging, monitoring and feedback can be found on relevant product\nwebsites, such as Gemini and Cloud Vertex AI.

Discussion and Conclusion\nWe have presented Gemini, a new family of models that advance multimodal model capabilities in\ntext, code, image, audio, and video. Our most capable pre-trained model Gemini Ultra, alongside\nthe post-trained Gemini Apps and Gemini API variants, make significant advances across the board.\nIn the natural language domain, the performance gains from careful developments in data and\nmodel training at scale continue to deliver quality improvements, setting new state of the art in\n39",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nseveral benchmarks. In particular, Gemini Ultra surpasses human-expert performance on the exam\nbenchmark MMLU, scoring 90.0%, which has been a defacto measure of progress for LLMs ever since\nit was first released in 2020. In the multimodal domain, Gemini Ultra sets new state of the art on most\nof the image understanding, video understanding, and audio understanding benchmarks without\ntask-specific modifications or tuning.In particular, Gemini Ultra’s multimodal reasoning capabilities\nare evident from its state-of-the-art performance on the recent MMMU benchmark (Yue et al., 2023),\nthat comprises questions about images requiring college-level subject knowledge and deliberate\nreasoning.\nBeyond the state-of-art results on benchmarks, what we are most excited about is the new use\ncases enabled by Gemini models. The new capabilities of Gemini models to parse complex images,\nsuch as charts or infographics, reason over interleaved sequences of images, audio, and text, and\ngenerate interleaved text and images as responses open a wide variety of new applications. As shown\nin figures throughout the report and appendix, Gemini models can enable new approaches in areas\nlike education, everyday problem solving, multilingual communication, information summarization,\nextraction, and creativity. We expect that the users of these models will find all kinds of beneficial\nnew uses that we have only scratched the surface of in our own investigations.\nDespite their impressive capabilities, we should note that there are limitations to the use of LLMs.\nThere is a continued need for ongoing research and development on “hallucinations” generated by\nLLMs to ensure that model outputs are more reliable and verifiable. LLMs also struggle with tasks\nrequiring high-level reasoning abilities like causal understanding, logical deduction, and counterfactual\nreasoning even though they achieve impressive performance on exam benchmarks. This underscores\nthe need for more challenging and robust evaluations to measure their true understanding as the\ncurrent state-of-the-art LLMs saturate many benchmarks.\nThe Gemini family is a further step towards our mission to solve intelligence, advance science\nand benefit humanity, and we are enthusiastic to see how these models are used by our colleagues\nat Google and beyond. We build on many innovations in machine learning, data, infrastructure,\nand responsible development – areas that we have been pursuing at Google for over a decade. The\nmodels we present in this report provide a strong foundation towards our broader future goal to\ndevelop a large-scale, modularized system that will have broad generalization capabilities across\nmany modalities.\n40",

    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\n10. Appendix\n10.1. Gemini Ultra Model Card\nModel summary\nModel architectureGemini V1.0 is a new family of state-of-the-art language models,\ncontaining variants known as Nano, Pro and Ultra (ordered\nby parameter count) based on a decoder-only Transformer\narchitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017a). Models are trained to\nsupport 32K context length, employing efficient attention\nmechanisms such as multi-query attention (Shazeer, 2019b).\nGemini is trained jointly across image, audio, video and text\ndata for the purpose of building a model with both strong\ngeneralist capabilities across modalities alongside cutting-edge\nunderstanding and reasoning performance in each respective\ndomain.\nThe  post-trained  models  described  in  this  model  card\nare Gemini API and Gemini Apps model variants (Section 6)\nbuilt on top of the Gemini Ultra pre-trained model. During the\npost-training process, additional architectural modifications are\nalso made to support the training of multi-objective reward\nmodels for RLHF.\nInput(s)Text (e.g. a question, a prompt, a document(s) to be summa-\nrized), images, video, audio files.\nOutput(s)Generated text in response to the input (e.g.  an answer to\nthe question, a summary of multiple documents, comparing\ndocuments/videos).\nUsage\nApplicationGemini is designed for accelerating research on language\nmodels, for use as a building block in features within Google\nproducts, and as a building block for select applications such as\nGemini App and Search Generative Experience.\nServices and products built on top of Gemini Ultra are\nalso being made available to external developers via Google\nCloud Vertex API and Google Labs, with additional process and\ntechnical safeguards related to safety policies.\nKnown CaveatsGemini should not be made available as part of a general-purpose\nservice or product, or used within a specific downstream appli-\ncation without a prior assessment and mitigation of the safety\nand fairness concerns specific to the downstream use.\n71",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nImplementation Frameworks\nHardware & SoftwareHardware: Training was conducted on TPUv4 and TPUv5e\n(Jouppi et al., 2020, 2023).\nSoftware:   JAX  (Bradbury  et  al.,  2018),  ML  Pathways\n(Dean, 2021).\nJAX allows researchers to leverage the latest generation\nof hardware, including TPUs, for faster and more efficient\ntraining of large models.\nML Pathways is infrastructure software to support Google’s\nefforts to build artificially intelligent systems capable of\ngeneralizing across multiple tasks. This is specially suitable for\nfoundation models, including large language models like the\nGemini V1.0 models.\nTogether, JAX and ML Pathways are used as described in\nSection 3.  The ’single controller’ programming model of\nJAX and ML Pathways allows a single Python process to\norchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the\ndevelopment workflow.\nCompute RequirementsNot reported.\nModel Characteristics\nModel initializationInitial pretraining used random initialization. Post-training was\ninitialized from checkpoints obtained at the later stages of pre-\ntraining. These checkpoints were fine-tuned using supervised\nfine-tuning, and subsequently used to initialize reward model\ntraining and RLHF.\nModel StatusThis is a static model trained on an offline dataset.\nModel StatsNot reported.\nData overview\nTraining DatasetGemini models are trained on a dataset that is both multimodal\nand multilingual. Our pre-training dataset uses data from web\ndocuments, books, and code, and includes image, audio, and\nvideo data.\nRefer to Section 4 (Pre-Training Dataset) for further de-\ntails.\n72",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nEvaluation DatasetWe compare pre- and post-trained Gemini Ultra models to a\nsuite of external LLMs and our previous best model PaLM 2\nacross a series of text-based academic benchmarks covering\nreasoning, reading comprehension, STEM, and coding.\nWe also evaluate Gemini models on four different mul-\ntimodal  capabilities:   high-level  object  recognition  using\ncaptioning or question-answering tasks such as VQAv2; fine-\ngrained transcription using tasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA\nrequiring the model to recognize low-level details;  chart\nunderstanding requiring spatial understanding of input layout\nusing ChartQA and InfographicVQA tasks; and multimodal\nreasoning using tasks such as Ai2D, MathVista and MMMU.\nRefer to Section 5 (Evaluation) for further details.\nPost-training DatasetFor post-training, we first collect a diverse set of prompts that\nare representative of real-world use cases.  We then collect\ndemonstration data of what the model’s output should be for\na given prompt for supervised fine-tuning. We further collect\ndifferent possible responses to a given prompt, and collect\nfeedback data over these to train reward models.\nRefer  to  Section  6.3  (Post-Training  Methods  and  Data)\nfor further details.\nEvaluation Results\nBenchmark InformationSee Section 5 (Evaluation).\nEvaluation ResultsSee Section 5 (Evaluation) and Section 6.4 (Post-Training Hu-\nman Evaluation).\nModel Usage & Limitations\nSensitive UseFor an analysis of risks and sensitive uses associated with the\nGemini models, see Section 7.1 (Impact Assessment).\nKnown LimitationsGemini models can exhibit limitations outlined in Section 7.1\n(Impact Assessment). Gemini models should not be used for\ndownstream applications without further analysis of potential\nharm in the proposed downstream application.\nEthical Considerations &\nRisks\nA reflection on the potential risks and impacts of the Gemini V1.0\nmodels can be found in Section 7 (Responsible Deployment).\nFor evaluation details for a range of risks, see Section 7.4 (Safety\nEvaluations).\n10.2. Chain-of-Thought Comparisons on MMLU benchmark\nWe contrast several chain-of-thought approaches on MMLU and discuss their results in this section. We\nproposed a new approach where model produces k chain-of-thought samples, selects the majority vote\nif the model is confident above a threshold, and otherwise defers to the greedy sample choice. The\n73",
    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\nthresholds are optimized for each model based on their validation split performance. The proposed\napproach is referred to asuncertainty-routed chain-of-thought. The intuition behind this approach\nis that chain-of-thought samples might degrade performance compared to the maximum-likelihood\ndecision when the model is demonstrably inconsistent. We compare the gains from the proposed\napproach on both Gemini Ultra and GPT-4 in Figure 9. We find that Gemini Ultra benefits more from\nthis approach compared to using only chain-of-thought samples. GPT-4’s performance improves from\n84.2% with greedy sampling to 87.3% with uncertainty-routed chain-of-thought approach with 32\nsamples, but it already achieves these gains from using 32 chain-of-thought samples. In contrast,\nGemini Ultra improves its performance significantly from 84.0% with greedy sampling to 90.0% with\nuncertainty-routed chain-of-thought approach with 32 samples while it marginally improves to 85.0%\nwith the use of 32 chain-of-thought samples only.\n87.2987.29\n84.21\n84.99\n90.04\n83.96\nScore EvalChain-of-Thought@32Chain-of-Thought@32\n(Uncertainty-Routed)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nGPT-4 (gpt-4-0613)Gemini Ultra\nMMLU accuracy (test split)\nFigure 9|Chain-of-Thought with uncertainty routing on MMLU.\n74",

How do I best take care of it?\nModel Response\nThis is a Persian shield plant. It is a tropical plant that is native to Southeast Asia. It is a\npopular houseplant because it is easy to care for and has beautiful purple leaves.\nPersian shield plants prefer bright, indirect light. They can tolerate some direct sunlight, but\ntoo much direct sunlight can scorch their leaves. They also prefer warm temperatures and\nhigh humidity.\nPersian shield plants need to be watered regularly, but they should not be allowed to sit in\nwater. The soil should be kept moist but not soggy. They also benefit from being misted regularly.\nPersian shield plants can be fertilized every two weeks during the growing season. A balanced\nfertilizer is a good choice.\nPersian shield plants are susceptible to pests, such as mealybugs and spider mites. These pests\ncan be controlled with insecticidal soap or neem oil.\nPersian shield plants can be propagated by stem cuttings. The cuttings should be taken in the\nspring or summer and should be rooted in water or a moist potting mix.\nFigure 11|Answering a multimodal information-seeking query.

A debate started in the comment\nsection of the article: one user claimed that the difference between the volumes of production\nbetween the two factories would get smaller and smaller in the next couple of years.\nCalculate the missing values of the table below and show that the above claim is not true.\nHeader: | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\nProduction volume of factory A (mln) | 500 | | | |\nProduction volume of factory B (mln) | 400 | | | |\nModel Response (rendered Markdown)\nYearProduction volume of\nfactory A (mln)\nProduction volume of\nfactory B (mln)\nDifference\n(mln)\n2018500400100\n2019525424101\n2020551.25449.44101.81\n2021578.81476.41102.4\nThe production volume of factory A in 2019 is 500 * 1.05 = 525 million forints.\nThe production volume of factory B in 2019 is 400 * 1.06 = 424 million forints.\nThe difference in production volume in 2019 is 525 - 424 = 101 million forints.\nThe production volume of factory A in 2020 is 525 * 1.05 = 551.25 million forints.\nThe production volume of factory B in 2020 is 424 * 1.06 = 449.44 million forints.\nThe difference in production volume in 2020 is 551.25 - 449.44 = 101.81 million forints.\nThe production volume of factory A in 2021 is 551.25 * 1.05 = 578.81 million forints.\nThe production volume of factory B in 2021 is 449.44 * 1.06 = 476.41 million forints.\nThe difference in production volume in 2021 is 578.81 - 476.41 = 102.4 million forints.\nAs you can see, the difference in production volume between the two factories is actually\nincreasing, not decreasing. Therefore, the claim that the difference between the volumes of\nproduction between the two factories would get smaller and smaller in the next couple of years\nis not true.\nFigure 21|Solving a multi-step math problem. The model is able to understand the task and generate\na markdown table with correctly calculated values. It also explicitly follows the instructions to show\nwhere the numbers come from and answer the question given in the task.\nSource: Oktatási Hivatal (2023, p. 20)\n88",

    "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models\n10.6.2. Video understanding and reasoning\nPrompt (video)\nHow could this person improve their technique?\nModel Response\nThis soccer player needs to work on their ball-striking mechanics. Their foot is not making\ngood contact with the ball, which is causing the ball to fly up and away from the goal. They\nalso need to work on their body positioning. They should be leaning into the shot with their\nnon-kicking leg in front of their kicking leg, and they should be following through with their\nkicking leg.\nFigure 23|Video understanding and reasoning over the situation presented in the video. Here, we\nprovide a video as input to the model together with a text prompt (images are provided here only\nfor visualization purposes). The model is able to analyze what happened in the video and provide\nrecommendations on how the actions in the video could have been better.\nVideo source: \"Football/Soccer Penalty Miss\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmWxjmJ3mvs\n90"
