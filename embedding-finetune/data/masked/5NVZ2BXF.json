These models\\ncan generate realistic images for a staggering variety of prompts and exhibit\\nimpressive compositional generalization abilities. Almost all use cases thus\\nfar have solely focused on sampling; however, diffusion models can also provide\\nconditional density estimates, which are useful for tasks beyond image\\ngeneration. In this paper, we show that the density estimates from large-scale\\ntext-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can be leveraged to\\nperform zero-shot classification without any additional training. Our\\ngenerative approach to classification, which we call Diffusion Classifier,\\nattains strong results on a variety of benchmarks and outperforms alternative\\nmethods of extracting knowledge from diffusion models. Although a gap remains\\nbetween generative and discriminative approaches on zero-shot recognition\\ntasks, our diffusion-based approach has significantly stronger multimodal\\ncompositional reasoning ability than competing discriminative approaches.\\nFinally, we use Diffusion Classifier to extract standard classifiers from\\nclass-conditional diffusion models trained on ImageNet. Our models achieve\\nstrong classification performance using only weak augmentations and exhibit\\nqualitatively better \\\"effective robustness\\\" to distribution shift.

The key insights are:\n\n- Diffusion models can be used as zero-shot classifiers by computing the ELBO (evidence lower bound) of the log-likelihood for each class and selecting the class with the lowest ELBO.\n- This \"Diffusion Classifier\" approach achieves strong results on a variety of zero-shot classification benchmarks, outperforming alternative methods of extracting knowledge from diffusion models.\n- Diffusion Classifier also exhibits significantly stronger multimodal compositional reasoning abilities compared to discriminative zero-shot models like CLIP.\n- When applied to the class-conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model trained on ImageNet, Diffusion Classifier achieves ImageNet classification accuracy competitive with discriminative models, while exhibiting better \"effective robustness\" to distribution shift.\n- The paper also provides insights into the interpretability of diffusion models through image generation experiments, and discusses practical considerations for efficient Diffusion Classifier inference.\n\nKeywords: diffusion models, zero-shot classification, compositional reasoning, generative classifiers, effective robustness\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does the zero-shot classification performance of Diffusion Classifier compare to state-of-the-art discriminative models like CLIP?\nA: Diffusion Classifier significantly outperforms the zero-shot diffusion model baseline that trains a classifier on synthetic Stable Diffusion data. It also generally outperforms the baseline trained on Stable Diffusion features, despite that baseline using the entire training set. Diffusion Classifier is competitive with the strong OpenCLIP ViT-H/14 model, despite the difficulty in making a fair comparison due to different training datasets.\n\nQ: What are some of the key insights from the paper about the compositional reasoning abilities of Diffusion Classifier compared to discriminative models?\nA: The paper shows that Diffusion Classifier significantly outperforms contrastive models like CLIP on the Winoground benchmark, which tests visio-linguistic compositional reasoning. This indicates that Diffusion Classifier's generative approach exhibits better cross-modal binding of concepts to images compared to the \"bag of concepts\" representations learned by discriminative models.\n\nQ: How does the supervised classification performance of Diffusion Classifier, using the class-conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model, compare to discriminative models trained on the same ImageNet dataset?\nA: Diffusion Classifier achieves ImageNet classification accuracy competitive with strong discriminative models like ResNet-101 and ViT-L/32, while using much weaker data augmentation during training. Notably, Diffusion Classifier also exhibits better \"effective robustness\" to distribution shift on the ImageNet-A benchmark compared to the discriminative models.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<summary>\nThe paper explores the field of leveraging generative models, specifically large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, for tasks beyond image generation, such as zero-shot and supervised image classification. It demonstrates how these models can be used to estimate conditional densities, which can then be applied to classification tasks without additional training.
