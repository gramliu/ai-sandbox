Experiments on three\\nlarge language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance\\non a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The\\nempirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter\\nlanguage model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the\\nart accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even\\nfinetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.\",\n  \"published\": \"2022-01-28T02:33:07Z\"\n}\n</metadata>\n<text>\nHere is a summary of the key points from the paper:\n\nSummary:\n- The paper introduces \"chain-of-thought prompting\" as a simple method to elicit multi-step reasoning abilities in large language models. This involves providing the model with a few examples of input-chain of thought-output triples during prompting.\n- Experiments show that chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks, especially for large language models of 100B+ parameters. This reasoning ability emerges as the model scale increases.\n- With chain-of-thought prompting, the 540B parameter PaLM model achieves new state-of-the-art results on several math word problem benchmarks, outperforming even finetuned models.\n- Chain-of-thought prompting also improves performance on commonsense reasoning tasks like CSQA and StrategyQA, and enables length generalization on symbolic manipulation tasks.\n- The paper provides analysis showing that the generated chains of thought are mostly coherent and logically correct, though factual errors can still occur.\n\nKeywords:\n- Chain-of-thought prompting\n- Multi-step reasoning\n- Large language models\n- Arithmetic reasoning\n- Commonsense reasoning\n- Symbolic reasoning\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does the performance of phi-3-mini compare to state-of-the-art large language models when evaluated on standard academic NLP benchmarks?\nA: Phi-3-mini achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks, despite having only 3.8B parameters. This demonstrates the power of carefully curated training data to enable high quality in compact models.\n\nQ: What techniques were used to ensure phi-3-mini behaves in a safe, robust, and responsible manner during open-ended interactions with humans?\nA: The phi-3-mini model underwent an iterative process of safety alignment via finetuning on helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets, red-teaming to identify potential issues, and extensive automated testing across dozens of responsibility and safety harm categories. However, challenges still remain in fully solving safety issues with language models.\n\nQ: How might the ability to run highly capable language models like phi-3-mini directly on consumer devices change the way AI assistants are developed and deployed in the future?\n(No definitive answer provided in the paper)\n\nQ: What are some potential beneficial applications of a model like phi-3-mini that can perform advanced language tasks while preserving user privacy by running fully on-device?\nA: Some potential applications include: 1) Privacy-preserving mobile AI assistants, 2) Embedded NLP systems for domains like healthcare where privacy is critical, 3) Democratization of advanced language AI capabilities to developers/researchers without access to massive computing resources.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<summary>The paper explores methods to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models by introducing a technique that involves providing examples of intermediate reasoning steps during the prompting process. This approach significantly improves the models' performance on various complex tasks, including arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. The research demonstrates that as the size of the language model increases, its ability to perform multi-step reasoning also improves. The paper also analyzes the coherence and logical correctness of the generated reasoning steps, noting that while they are generally accurate, some factual errors can still occur.</summary>"
