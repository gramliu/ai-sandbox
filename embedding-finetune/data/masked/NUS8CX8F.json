In particular, we study the importance of various architecture\\ncomponents and data choices. Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the\\nimage encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data\\nchoices, we identified several crucial design lessons. For example, we\\ndemonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of\\nimage-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for\\nachieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks,\\ncompared to other published pre-training results. Further, we show that the\\nimage encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has\\nsubstantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of\\ncomparatively negligible importance. By scaling up the presented recipe, we\\nbuild MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, including both\\ndense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in\\npre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised\\nfine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks. Thanks to\\nlarge-scale pre-training, MM1 enjoys appealing properties such as enhanced\\nin-context learning, and multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot\\nchain-of-thought prompting.\\n\",\n  \"published\": \"2024-03-14T17:51:32Z\"\n}\n</metadata>\n<text>\nHere is a summary of the key points from the paper:\n\nKeywords:\n- Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\n- Image encoder pre-training\n- Vision-language connector\n- Multimodal pre-training data mixture\n- Scaling up MLLMs\n- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\n- Few-shot learning and multi-image reasoning\n\nKey Findings:\n- Through careful ablations, the authors identify important design choices for building performant MLLMs:\n  - Image resolution and encoder pre-training are most important for the visual encoder\n  - The vision-language connector design has little impact, while the number of visual tokens matters most\n  - A careful mixture of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art few-shot performance\n- Scaling up the model size from 3B to 30B parameters, as well as exploring mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, leads to a family of highly capable MLLM models (MM1) that outperform prior work on a range of benchmarks.\n- Thanks to large-scale multimodal pre-training, MM1 exhibits appealing properties like enhanced in-context learning and multi-image reasoning, enabling strong few-shot performance.\n- The authors show that the lessons learned from pre-training ablations transfer to the final SFT models, demonstrating the importance of careful model and data design choices.\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does the image encoder pre-training objective (contrastive vs. reconstructive) impact the performance of the final MLLM model?\nA: The authors find that contrastive pre-training methods like CLIP tend to outperform reconstructive methods like AIM, though the results are inconclusive due to differences in training data size.\n\nQ: What is the impact of including text-only data during multimodal pre-training, and how does it interact with the mixture of image-caption and interleaved image-text data?\nA: The authors show that text-only data is crucial for maintaining strong few-shot and text-only performance, while the mixture of image-caption and interleaved image-text data is important for zero-shot and multimodal performance.\n\nQ: How does the MM1 model family leverage few-shot learning and multi-image reasoning capabilities enabled by large-scale multimodal pre-training?\nA: The authors demonstrate that MM1 models can leverage in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning over multiple images, outperforming prior work on benchmarks like MathVista that require these advanced capabilities.\n</text>\n</reference>",
