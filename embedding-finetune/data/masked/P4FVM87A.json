However, in other ways, LLMs are a\\nstep backward from traditional special-purpose NLP models; they require\\nextensive computational resources for deployment and can be gated behind APIs.\\nIn this paper, we propose Prompt2Model, a general-purpose method that takes a\\nnatural language task description like the prompts provided to LLMs, and uses\\nit to train a special-purpose model that is conducive to deployment. This is\\ndone through a multi-step process of retrieval of existing datasets and\\npretrained models, dataset generation using LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning on\\nthese retrieved and generated datasets. Over three tasks, we demonstrate that\\ngiven the same few-shot prompt as input, Prompt2Model trains models that\\noutperform the results of a strong LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo, by an average of 20%\\nwhile being up to 700 times smaller. We also show that this data can be used to\\nobtain reliable performance estimates of model performance, enabling model\\ndevelopers to assess model reliability before deployment.

This combination was found to be more effective than using either retrieved or generated data alone.\n\nQ: Can the synthetic evaluation data generated by Prompt2Model reliably identify real performance improvements across different model candidates?\nA: Yes, the paper shows that the synthetic evaluation data generated by Prompt2Model was able to reliably rank different model candidates in the same order as the real benchmark datasets.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<summary>\nThe paper explores the field of natural language processing (NLP) with a focus on creating deployable models from natural language instructions. It addresses the challenge of balancing the ease of prototyping with large language models and the need for efficient, special-purpose models suitable for deployment. The proposed method involves a multi-step process that includes retrieving relevant datasets and pretrained models, generating synthetic data, and fine-tuning a model on this combined data. This approach aims to produce smaller, yet highly effective models that can be reliably evaluated before deployment.\n</summary>"
