S2A first regenerates the input context to only include the relevant portions, before having the LLM attend to this refined context to produce the final output. \n\nThe key findings and highlights are:\n\n- S2A outperforms standard attention-based LLMs on tasks containing opinion or irrelevant information, such as factual QA, math word problems, and longform generation. It increases factuality, objectivity, and reduces sycophancy.\n\n- On a modified TriviaQA dataset with opinionated prompts, S2A achieves 80.3% accuracy, close to the 82% of an oracle prompt without the opinions.\n\n- On longform generation with opinionated prompts, S2A increases objectivity by 57.4% compared to the baseline.\n\n- On math word problems with irrelevant sentences, S2A improves accuracy from 51.7% to 61.3%.\n\nKeywords: large language models, attention mechanisms, reasoning, context regeneration, sycophancy, factuality, objectivity\n\nExample Questions:\n\nQ: How does the performance of phi-3-mini compare to state-of-the-art large language models when evaluated on standard academic NLP benchmarks?\nA: Phi-3-mini achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks, despite having only 3.8B parameters. This demonstrates the power of carefully curated training data to enable high quality in compact models.\n\nQ: What techniques were used to ensure phi-3-mini behaves in a safe, robust, and responsible manner during open-ended interactions with humans?\nA: The phi-3-mini model underwent an iterative process of safety alignment via finetuning on helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets, red-teaming to identify potential issues, and extensive automated testing across dozens of responsibility and safety harm categories.\n\nQ: How might the ability to run highly capable language models like phi-3-mini directly on consumer devices change the way AI assistants are developed and deployed in the future?\nA: Some potential applications include privacy-preserving mobile AI assistants, embedded NLP systems for domains like healthcare where privacy is critical, and democratization of advanced language AI capabilities to developers/researchers without access to massive computing resources.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<summary>The paper explores advancements in the field of large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on improving the attention mechanisms used by these models. It addresses the issue of LLMs incorporating irrelevant information from the input context, which can negatively impact the quality of generated responses. The proposed method involves regenerating the input context to filter out irrelevant parts before the model processes it, thereby enhancing the factuality, objectivity, and overall accuracy of the responses. This approach is particularly beneficial for tasks that require precise and relevant information extraction, such as question answering, solving math word problems, and generating longform content.</summary>"
