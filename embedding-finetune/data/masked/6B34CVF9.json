Here, we\\npursue this hypothesis by developing a family of $\\\\textbf{Representation\\nFinetuning (ReFT)}$ methods. ReFT methods operate on a frozen base model and\\nlearn task-specific interventions on hidden representations. We define a strong\\ninstance of the ReFT family, Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT). LoReFT is\\na drop-in replacement for existing PEFTs and learns interventions that are\\n10x-50x more parameter-efficient than prior state-of-the-art PEFTs. We showcase\\nLoReFT on eight commonsense reasoning tasks, four arithmetic reasoning tasks,\\nAlpaca-Eval v1.0, and GLUE. In all these evaluations, LoReFT delivers the best\\nbalance of efficiency and performance, and almost always outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art PEFTs.

This allows them to achieve strong performance with much more compact interventions.\n\nQ: How might the ability to run highly capable language models like phi-3-mini directly on consumer devices change the development and deployment of AI assistants in the future?\nA: (No answer provided, as the paper does not discuss this specific question.)\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<summary>\nThe paper explores the field of parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models. It focuses on methods that adapt models by modifying hidden representations rather than updating model weights. This approach leverages the rich semantic information encoded in these representations to achieve task-specific adaptations. The research demonstrates that such methods can significantly reduce the number of parameters required while maintaining or improving performance across various reasoning and understanding tasks.\n</summary>"
