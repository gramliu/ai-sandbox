The key innovations are:\n\n1. A novel hybrid region representation that integrates discrete coordinates and continuous visual features to represent versatile regions like points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes.\n2. A spatial-aware visual sampler that can extract continuous features for regions of varying sparsity.\n3. The curation of GRIT, a comprehensive refer-and-ground instruction tuning dataset with 1.1M samples covering hierarchical spatial knowledge and hard negative data.\n\nFerret achieves superior performance on classical referring and grounding tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art MLLMs. It also greatly outperforms existing models on new Ferret-Bench tasks that evaluate multimodal chatting with referring and grounding capabilities. Ferret also exhibits a remarkable reduction in object hallucination compared to other MLLMs.\n\nKeywords: multimodal language models, spatial understanding, referring, grounding, instruction tuning\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does Ferret's hybrid region representation enable it to handle diverse input formats like points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes, unlike previous models?\nA: Ferret's hybrid representation combines discrete coordinates and continuous visual features, allowing it to effectively represent and process a wide range of region types, from simple points to complex free-form shapes. This flexibility is a key innovation that sets Ferret apart from prior work.\n\nQ: How did the curation of the GRIT dataset, including instruction-following data and hard negative samples, help improve Ferret's referring and grounding capabilities as well as its robustness?\nA: The GRIT dataset provided Ferret with a diverse and comprehensive training set that covered hierarchical spatial knowledge, from individual objects to complex relationships and reasoning. The inclusion of hard negative samples also helped the model become more robust, reducing issues like object hallucination that plague many other MLLMs.\n\nQ: How could the ability of Ferret to perform advanced referring and grounding within open-ended multimodal conversations be leveraged in practical applications like mobile AI assistants or embedded systems for privacy-sensitive domains?\nA: Ferret's compact size and on-device inference capability, combined with its strong referring and grounding skills, could enable the development of privacy-preserving mobile AI assistants that can engage in rich, spatially-aware dialogues without relying on cloud-based processing. This could also benefit embedded systems in domains like healthcare, where maintaining user privacy is critical. The democratization of such advanced language AI capabilities to a wider range of developers and researchers is another potential application.\n</text>\n</reference>",
