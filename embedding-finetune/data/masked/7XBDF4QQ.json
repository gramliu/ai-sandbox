Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear\\nattention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space\\nmodels (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational\\ninefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as\\nattention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key\\nweakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning,\\nand make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be\\nfunctions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities,\\nallowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the\\nsequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though\\nthis change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a\\nhardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these\\nselective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without\\nattention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\\\times$\\nhigher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and\\nits performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a\\ngeneral sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance\\nacross several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language\\nmodeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and\\nmatches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream\\nevaluation.\\n\",\n  \"published\": \"2023-12-01T18:01:34Z\"\n}\n</metadata>\n<text>\nSummary:\n\nThis paper introduces Mamba, a new architecture for sequence modeling that combines selective state space models (S6) with a simplified block design. The key innovations are:\n\n1. Selective State Space Models (S6): Mamba incorporates a selection mechanism into structured state space models (SSMs), allowing the model parameters to be input-dependent. This enables the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence, which is crucial for tasks like the Selective Copying task.\n\n2. Hardware-Aware Selective Scan: To efficiently compute the selective SSMs, the authors develop a hardware-aware algorithm that leverages the memory hierarchy of modern GPUs, achieving up to 20-40x speedup over a standard implementation.\n\n3. Simplified Architecture: Mamba simplifies prior SSM architectures by combining the H3 block (which interleaves an SSM with an MLP) into a single homogenous block, leading to a simpler and more efficient design.\n\nKey Findings:\n- Mamba outperforms prior SSM-based models and matches the performance of strong Transformer baselines on a variety of tasks, including language modeling, DNA sequence modeling, and audio waveform modeling.\n- Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model to truly achieve Transformer-level performance, both in pretraining and downstream evaluations.\n- Mamba's selective mechanism allows it to easily solve synthetic tasks like Selective Copying and Induction Heads, where prior LTI models struggle.\n- Mamba's performance improves monotonically with longer context lengths, up to sequences of 1 million tokens, demonstrating its ability to effectively utilize long-range information.\n\nKeywords: Selective state space models, linear-time sequence modeling, hardware-aware algorithms, simplified neural network architectures\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does Mamba's selective mechanism allow it to outperform prior SSM-based models on tasks like Selective Copying?\nA: Mamba's selective mechanism allows the model parameters to be input-dependent, enabling the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence. This is crucial for tasks like Selective Copying, where the model needs to focus on and remember the relevant input tokens while ignoring the irrelevant ones.\n\nQ: How does Mamba achieve linear-time scaling in sequence length, and what hardware-aware techniques does it use to make this efficient on modern GPUs?\nA: Mamba achieves linear-time scaling by using a selective state space model (S6) computed via a parallel scan algorithm. To make this efficient on GPUs, Mamba uses kernel fusion to reduce memory I/O, and recomputation to avoid materializing large intermediate states.\n\nQ: How does Mamba's performance compare to Transformers on language modeling, and what are the implications for using Mamba as a general sequence modeling backbone?\nA: Mamba matches or exceeds the performance of Transformers on language modeling, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations, while being 5x faster at inference. This suggests Mamba could be a strong candidate as a general sequence modeling backbone, particularly for applications requiring long-range context or efficient inference.\n</text>\n</reference>",
