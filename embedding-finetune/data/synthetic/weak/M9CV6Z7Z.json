Key points:\n\n- Motivation: LLMs struggle with SKG tasks compared to specialized models, despite their strong performance on plain text. StructLM aims to build a generalist model for diverse SKG tasks.\n\n- Dataset: The authors curated a 1.1M example dataset covering 18 SKG tasks across structured data types like tables, databases, and knowledge graphs. This dataset was used for instruction-based finetuning.\n\n- Results: StructLM outperforms specialized SKG models on 16 out of 18 held-in tasks, and establishes new state-of-the-art on 8 tasks. It also shows strong zero-shot generalization to 6 novel held-out SKG tasks, outperforming other generalist models like Flan-UL2 and TableLlama.\n\n- Ablations: The authors find that code-pretraining is most beneficial for SKG performance, and that including general instruction-following data helps preserve generalization. They also observe diminishing returns from scaling model size.\n\nKeywords: Structured Knowledge Grounding, Large Language Models, Instruction Tuning, Generalization\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does the performance of StructLM compare to specialized SKG models and other generalist LLMs like Flan-UL2 and TableLlama?\nA: StructLM outperforms specialized SKG models on 16 out of 18 held-in tasks, and establishes new state-of-the-art on 8 tasks. It also significantly outperforms Flan-UL2 and TableLlama on the 6 held-out SKG tasks, by 10% and 35% on average respectively.\n\nQ: What factors were found to be most important for StructLM's strong SKG performance?\nA: The authors found that code-pretraining was the most beneficial pretraining regime for SKG tasks, outperforming math-pretraining and the base Llama2 model. They also observed that including general instruction-following data helped preserve StructLM's generalization ability on the held-out tasks.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<note>\nIt's been a busy day at the office, but I'm feeling energized and excited about the progress we're making on our latest project. A big part of what we're working on involves integrating structured data sources like databases and knowledge graphs into our language models. It's been a real eye-opener to see just how much room for improvement there is in this area.\n\nThis morning, I spent some time reviewing the latest research on Structured Knowledge Grounding (SKG) tasks. It's fascinating to see how even the most advanced language models like ChatGPT can struggle with these types of challenges, lagging behind specialized models by a significant margin. That's why I'm really intrigued by this new StructLM series that the researchers have developed.\n\nThe idea of building a generalist model that can excel at a wide range of SKG tasks is really compelling. And the fact that they were able to outperform task-specific models on 16 out of 18 benchmarks, while also establishing new state-of-the-art performance on 8 tasks, is really impressive. I'm especially interested in how StructLM was able to generalize so well to the novel held-out tasks, outperforming other generalist models like Flan-UL2 and TableLlama.\n\nAs I was digging into the technical details, I was struck by the importance of the pretraining regime. It seems that code-pretraining was a key factor in StructLM's strong performance, which makes sense given the structured nature of the tasks. And the inclusion of general instruction-following data also helped preserve the model's generalization abilities.\n\nI'm really curious to see how StructLM and other models in this space continue to evolve. It feels like we're on the cusp of a major breakthrough in terms of building language models that can truly understand and leverage structured data sources. And that could have huge implications for all sorts of real-world applications, from e-commerce to scientific research.\n\nAnyway, I better get back to work. I've got a meeting with the team to discuss our own plans for integrating more structured data into our systems. It's going to be an exciting challenge, but I'm confident that we're up for it.\n</note>"
