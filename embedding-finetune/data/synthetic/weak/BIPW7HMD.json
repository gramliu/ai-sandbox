S2A first regenerates the input context to only include the relevant portions, before having the LLM attend to this refined context to produce the final output. \n\nThe key findings and highlights are:\n\n- S2A outperforms standard attention-based LLMs on tasks containing opinion or irrelevant information, such as factual QA, math word problems, and longform generation. It increases factuality, objectivity, and reduces sycophancy.\n\n- On a modified TriviaQA dataset with opinionated prompts, S2A achieves 80.3% accuracy, close to the 82% of an oracle prompt without the opinions.\n\n- On longform generation with opinionated prompts, S2A increases objectivity by 57.4% compared to the baseline.\n\n- On math word problems with irrelevant sentences, S2A improves accuracy from 51.7% to 61.3%.\n\nKeywords: large language models, attention mechanisms, reasoning, context regeneration, sycophancy, factuality, objectivity\n\nExample Questions:\n\nQ: How does the performance of phi-3-mini compare to state-of-the-art large language models when evaluated on standard academic NLP benchmarks?\nA: Phi-3-mini achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks, despite having only 3.8B parameters. This demonstrates the power of carefully curated training data to enable high quality in compact models.\n\nQ: What techniques were used to ensure phi-3-mini behaves in a safe, robust, and responsible manner during open-ended interactions with humans?\nA: The phi-3-mini model underwent an iterative process of safety alignment via finetuning on helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets, red-teaming to identify potential issues, and extensive automated testing across dozens of responsibility and safety harm categories.\n\nQ: How might the ability to run highly capable language models like phi-3-mini directly on consumer devices change the way AI assistants are developed and deployed in the future?\nA: Some potential applications include privacy-preserving mobile AI assistants, embedded NLP systems for domains like healthcare where privacy is critical, and democratization of advanced language AI capabilities to developers/researchers without access to massive computing resources.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<note>\nToday was an interesting day at work as I continued exploring ways to improve the reasoning capabilities of our language models. I spent a good chunk of the morning diving into the details of this new \"System 2 Attention\" technique that was just published. The core idea is to have the model first regenerate the input context to only include the most relevant information, before using that refined context to generate the final output. \n\nIt's a fascinating approach, and the results on tasks like factual QA, math word problems, and longform generation are quite impressive. I can see how this could really help address some of the issues we've been facing with our current models, like incorporating irrelevant information or being overly swayed by opinions in the input. The ability to reason about what's truly relevant and then focus the attention accordingly is a big step forward.\n\nAfter reviewing the paper, I had a meeting with the team to discuss potential ways we could incorporate similar techniques into our own systems. We brainstormed ideas around building in more explicit reasoning steps, perhaps using natural language instructions to guide the model's attention. It's going to take some experimentation, but I'm excited about the prospect of creating language models that are more robust, objective, and factually grounded.\n\nIn the afternoon, I took a break to work on a personal project I've been tinkering with - a tool that can help automate some of the repetitive tasks involved in collaborative software development. One of the key challenges I'm facing is ensuring the tool can handle a wide variety of scenarios without getting tripped up by edge cases. I'm starting to think that some of the techniques from the System 2 Attention paper could be applicable here as well, helping the tool focus on the truly relevant information and make more informed decisions.\n\nAs I wrapped up for the day, I couldn't help but feel inspired by the rapid progress happening in this field. It's amazing to see how far language models have come, and the potential they have to tackle increasingly complex, real-world problems. I'm excited to keep exploring these ideas and see what we can build next.\n</note>"
