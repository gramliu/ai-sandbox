Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a\\npracticable complement to LLMs, it relies heavily on the relevance of retrieved\\ndocuments, raising concerns about how the model behaves if retrieval goes\\nwrong. To this end, we propose the Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation\\n(CRAG) to improve the robustness of generation. Specifically, a lightweight\\nretrieval evaluator is designed to assess the overall quality of retrieved\\ndocuments for a query, returning a confidence degree based on which different\\nknowledge retrieval actions can be triggered. Since retrieval from static and\\nlimited corpora can only return sub-optimal documents, large-scale web searches\\nare utilized as an extension for augmenting the retrieval results. Besides, a\\ndecompose-then-recompose algorithm is designed for retrieved documents to\\nselectively focus on key information and filter out irrelevant information in\\nthem. CRAG is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly coupled with various\\nRAG-based approaches. Experiments on four datasets covering short- and\\nlong-form generation tasks show that CRAG can significantly improve the\\nperformance of RAG-based approaches.\\n\",\n  \"published\": \"2024-01-29T04:36:39Z\"\n}\n</metadata>\n<text>\nHere is a summary of the key points from the paper:\n\nHighlights:\n- The paper introduces Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG), a method to improve the robustness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches.\n- CRAG uses a lightweight retrieval evaluator to assess the quality of retrieved documents and trigger different knowledge retrieval actions (Correct, Incorrect, Ambiguous).\n- For Incorrect retrievals, CRAG leverages large-scale web searches to complement the limited corpus.\n- CRAG also uses a decompose-then-recompose algorithm to selectively focus on key information in retrieved documents.\n- Experiments show CRAG can significantly improve the performance of standard RAG and state-of-the-art Self-RAG across short-form and long-form generation tasks.\n\nKeywords:\n- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\n- Hallucination\n- Retrieval evaluator\n- Knowledge refinement\n- Web search\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does the performance of phi-3-mini compare to state-of-the-art large language models when evaluated on standard academic NLP benchmarks?\nA: Phi-3-mini achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks, demonstrating the power of carefully curated training data to enable high quality in compact models.\n\nQ: What techniques were used to ensure phi-3-mini behaves in a safe, robust, and responsible manner during open-ended interactions with humans?\nA: The phi-3-mini model underwent an iterative process of safety alignment, red-teaming, and extensive automated testing to mitigate issues around factual inaccuracies, bias, inappropriate content, and safety, though challenges still remain in fully solving these problems.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<note>\nToday was an interesting day at work as we continued exploring ways to make our language models more robust and reliable. I spent a good chunk of the morning reviewing the latest research on Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG) - it's a fascinating approach that aims to address some of the shortcomings of standard retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.\n\nThe key idea behind CRAG is using a lightweight retrieval evaluator to assess the quality of the documents that are retrieved to supplement the language model's knowledge. Based on this assessment, the system can then trigger different actions - like reaching out to the broader web to find more relevant information if the initial retrieval was deemed inadequate. It's a clever way to add an extra layer of robustness and help mitigate issues like hallucination.\n\nI'm particularly intrigued by the decompose-then-recompose algorithm they use to selectively focus on the most salient information in the retrieved documents. It seems like a smart way to filter out irrelevant details and hone in on what's truly important. I wonder how we could adapt a similar technique for some of our own projects.\n\nIn the afternoon, I had a meeting with the team to discuss our progress on integrating more advanced AI capabilities into our e-commerce platform. We're really trying to push the boundaries in terms of creating a seamless, intuitive user experience powered by natural language processing. Of course, it's not without its challenges - we're still grappling with how to ensure the system behaves robustly and reliably, even when faced with edge cases or incomplete information.\n\nAs I was leaving the office, I couldn't help but reflect on how rapidly the field of AI is evolving. It's both exciting and a bit daunting to think about the potential impact these technologies could have, not just on our work, but on society as a whole. I'm glad we're taking a thoughtful, responsible approach to development, but there's still so much more to figure out. I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds.\n</note>"
