  "input": "<reference id=\"7ZSCH5PA\">\n<metadata>\n{\n  \"title\": \"One Embedder, Any Task: Instruction-Finetuned Text Embeddings\",\n  \"abstract\": \"  We introduce INSTRUCTOR, a new method for computing text embeddings given\\ntask instructions: every text input is embedded together with instructions\\nexplaining the use case (e.g., task and domain descriptions). Unlike encoders\\nfrom prior work that are more specialized, INSTRUCTOR is a single embedder that\\ncan generate text embeddings tailored to different downstream tasks and\\ndomains, without any further training. We first annotate instructions for 330\\ndiverse tasks and train INSTRUCTOR on this multitask mixture with a contrastive\\nloss. We evaluate INSTRUCTOR on 70 embedding evaluation tasks (66 of which are\\nunseen during training), ranging from classification and information retrieval\\nto semantic textual similarity and text generation evaluation. INSTRUCTOR,\\nwhile having an order of magnitude fewer parameters than the previous best\\nmodel, achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average improvement of\\n3.4% compared to the previous best results on the 70 diverse datasets. Our\\nanalysis suggests that INSTRUCTOR is robust to changes in instructions, and\\nthat instruction finetuning mitigates the challenge of training a single model\\non diverse datasets.

This is in contrast to prior embedding models that are more specialized.\n\nKey Findings:\n- INSTRUCTOR is trained on a new dataset called MEDI, which contains 330 diverse text embedding datasets annotated with human-written task instructions.\n- INSTRUCTOR outperforms prior state-of-the-art embedding models by an average of 3.4% on 70 diverse evaluation datasets spanning classification, semantic textual similarity, information retrieval, text generation evaluation, and prompt retrieval.\n- The instruction-based finetuning enables INSTRUCTOR to benefit from diverse training data, whereas models trained without instructions struggle when faced with a mix of symmetric and asymmetric tasks.\n- INSTRUCTOR demonstrates robustness to paraphrased instructions, especially when trained on the diverse Super-NI datasets.\n- Scaling up the model size leads to greater performance gains for INSTRUCTOR compared to the base GTR model, suggesting instructions require additional model capacity.\n\nKeywords: text embeddings, instruction-based finetuning, multitask learning, zero-shot transfer\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does INSTRUCTOR's performance compare to prior state-of-the-art embedding models on a wide range of downstream tasks?\nA: INSTRUCTOR outperforms the previous best model, Sent-T5-XXL, by an average of 3.4% across 70 diverse evaluation datasets, despite having an order of magnitude fewer parameters.\n\nQ: What is the key innovation in INSTRUCTOR's training approach that enables it to perform well on such a wide variety of tasks?\nA: The key innovation is INSTRUCTOR's use of natural language instructions describing the task and domain, which are provided along with the text input during training. This instruction-based finetuning allows INSTRUCTOR to benefit from diverse training data and generalize better to unseen tasks.\n\nQ: How does INSTRUCTOR's performance scale with model size compared to the base GTR model? What does this suggest about the role of model capacity for instruction-based embeddings?\nA: INSTRUCTOR sees greater performance gains from scaling up the model size compared to the base GTR model. This suggests that instructions require additional model capacity to be effectively encoded, beyond what is needed for standard text embeddings.\n\nQ: How does INSTRUCTOR's robustness to paraphrased instructions compare to prior instruction-finetuned models? What dataset design choices contributed to this improved robustness?\nA: INSTRUCTOR demonstrates significantly improved robustness to paraphrased instructions compared to prior work. This is attributed to the diverse task definitions in the Super-NI datasets used for training, which helped the model handle a wider range of instruction styles and formats.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<note>\nIt's been a busy day at the office, but I'm feeling energized and excited about the work we're doing. This morning, I spent some time experimenting with our latest text embedding model, INSTRUCTOR. I'm really impressed by how versatile it is - the ability to generate task-specific embeddings just by providing a natural language instruction is a game-changer.\n\nOne of the things I love about INSTRUCTOR is how it can handle such a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification to information retrieval to text generation evaluation. It's like having a Swiss Army knife of text embeddings. And the fact that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models by a significant margin, despite being an order of magnitude smaller, is just icing on the cake.\n\nAs I was testing INSTRUCTOR on some of our internal datasets, I noticed how robust it is to paraphrased instructions. That's a really important feature, especially when you're dealing with diverse user inputs. The team did a great job designing the training data to capture that kind of variability.\n\nI also found it fascinating how scaling up the model size had a bigger impact on INSTRUCTOR's performance compared to the base GTR model. It really highlights the importance of having sufficient capacity to effectively encode those task-specific instructions. I can't wait to see how we can leverage INSTRUCTOR to build even more powerful and versatile language AI systems.\n\nIn the afternoon, I had a meeting with the product team to discuss some new features we're planning for our content management platform. We're exploring ways to integrate INSTRUCTOR's embedding capabilities to enhance the user experience, like personalized search and recommendation. The possibilities are endless!\n\nOverall, it's been a really productive and inspiring day. I'm grateful to be part of a team that's pushing the boundaries of what's possible with language AI. Can't wait to see what tomorrow brings!\n</note>"
