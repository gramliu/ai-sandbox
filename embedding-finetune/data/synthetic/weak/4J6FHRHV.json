To fill\\nthe gap, we present an end-to-end general-purpose any-to-any MM-LLM system,\\nNExT-GPT. We connect an LLM with multimodal adaptors and different diffusion\\ndecoders, enabling NExT-GPT to perceive inputs and generate outputs in\\narbitrary combinations of text, images, videos, and audio. By leveraging the\\nexisting well-trained highly-performing encoders and decoders, NExT-GPT is\\ntuned with only a small amount of parameter (1%) of certain projection layers,\\nwhich not only benefits low-cost training and also facilitates convenient\\nexpansion to more potential modalities. Moreover, we introduce a\\nmodality-switching instruction tuning (MosIT) and manually curate a\\nhigh-quality dataset for MosIT, based on which NExT-GPT is empowered with\\ncomplex cross-modal semantic understanding and content generation. Overall, our\\nresearch showcases the promising possibility of building an AI agent capable of\\nmodeling universal modalities, paving the way for more human-like AI research\\nin the community.

  "output": "<note>\nToday was an exciting day at work as we continued to make progress on our latest project involving a highly capable multimodal language model. I spent the morning reviewing the technical details of the NExT-GPT system that we've been experimenting with. It's truly remarkable how this model can seamlessly handle inputs and outputs across a wide range of modalities, including text, images, videos, and even audio.\n\nWhat's particularly impressive is the way NExT-GPT was designed to be efficient and expandable. By leveraging existing high-performance encoders and decoders, and only requiring updates to a small fraction of the parameters, the team was able to create a system that is both powerful and cost-effective to train and deploy. I can see how this approach could make it much easier to incorporate new modalities in the future as the technology continues to evolve.\n\nDuring our team meeting, we discussed the potential applications of a multimodal language model like NExT-GPT. The ability to engage in complex, multi-turn dialogues that involve switching between different modalities could be truly transformative for human-AI interaction. I can envision scenarios where users could fluidly communicate with an AI assistant using a combination of text, images, and even voice commands to accomplish a wide variety of tasks.\n\nOne area that particularly excites me is the potential for NExT-GPT to enhance collaboration between humans and AI systems. Imagine being able to work on a project together, with the AI seamlessly understanding and responding to your inputs, whether you're sharing a document, sketching a diagram, or discussing ideas out loud. The possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to see how this technology evolves and is applied in real-world settings.\n\nAs I left the office today, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and optimism about the future of AI. The advancements we're seeing in areas like multimodal language models are truly remarkable, and I'm grateful to be a part of this exciting journey. I can't wait to see what tomorrow brings!\n</note>"
