Experiments on three\\nlarge language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance\\non a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The\\nempirical gains can be striking.

This involves providing the model with a few examples of input-chain of thought-output triples during prompting.\n- Experiments show that chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks, especially for large language models of 100B+ parameters. This reasoning ability emerges as the model scale increases.\n- With chain-of-thought prompting, the 540B parameter PaLM model achieves new state-of-the-art results on several math word problem benchmarks, outperforming even finetuned models.\n- Chain-of-thought prompting also improves performance on commonsense reasoning tasks like CSQA and StrategyQA, and enables length generalization on symbolic manipulation tasks.\n- The paper provides analysis showing that the generated chains of thought are mostly coherent and logically correct, though factual errors can still occur.\n\nKeywords:\n- Chain-of-thought prompting\n- Multi-step reasoning\n- Large language models\n- Arithmetic reasoning\n- Commonsense reasoning\n- Symbolic reasoning\n\nExample Questions:\nQ: How does the performance of phi-3-mini compare to state-of-the-art large language models when evaluated on standard academic NLP benchmarks?\nA: Phi-3-mini achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks, despite having only 3.8B parameters. This demonstrates the power of carefully curated training data to enable high quality in compact models.\n\nQ: What techniques were used to ensure phi-3-mini behaves in a safe, robust, and responsible manner during open-ended interactions with humans?\nA: The phi-3-mini model underwent an iterative process of safety alignment via finetuning on helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets, red-teaming to identify potential issues, and extensive automated testing across dozens of responsibility and safety harm categories. However, challenges still remain in fully solving safety issues with language models.\n\nQ: How might the ability to run highly capable language models like phi-3-mini directly on consumer devices change the way AI assistants are developed and deployed in the future?\n(No definitive answer provided in the paper)\n\nQ: What are some potential beneficial applications of a model like phi-3-mini that can perform advanced language tasks while preserving user privacy by running fully on-device?\nA: Some potential applications include: 1) Privacy-preserving mobile AI assistants, 2) Embedded NLP systems for domains like healthcare where privacy is critical, 3) Democratization of advanced language AI capabilities to developers/researchers without access to massive computing resources.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<note>\nToday was an interesting day at work as we continued exploring ways to enhance the reasoning capabilities of our AI models. I spent a good portion of the morning reviewing the latest research on chain-of-thought prompting, which seems to be a promising approach for eliciting multi-step reasoning from large language models.\n\nThe idea of providing the model with a few examples of input-chain of thought-output triples during prompting is quite fascinating. It's amazing to see how this simple technique can significantly boost performance on a range of complex tasks, from arithmetic word problems to commonsense reasoning. I'm particularly intrigued by the results on the GSM8K math benchmark, where the 540B-parameter PaLM model was able to outperform even finetuned GPT-3 models.\n\nAfter the morning meeting, I started experimenting with incorporating chain-of-thought prompting into our own models. It's been a bit of a challenge to get the right balance of exemplars and task formulation, but I'm cautiously optimistic about the initial results. I can already see how the generated reasoning chains are helping the model tackle problems in a more structured and coherent way.\n\nOne of the key things I'm focused on is ensuring the safety and robustness of our AI systems. While the reasoning abilities are impressive, the paper did note that factual errors can still creep in. We'll need to be diligent about testing and validation to address these kinds of issues. I'm also curious to explore how we can further enhance the model's commonsense understanding and ability to handle symbolic manipulation tasks.\n\nIn the afternoon, I had a chance to catch up with the team working on our mobile AI assistant project. They're really excited about the potential of running highly capable language models like this directly on consumer devices. The idea of preserving user privacy while still providing advanced AI capabilities is a really compelling one. I'm looking forward to seeing how that project evolves.\n\nOverall, it's been a productive and thought-provoking day. I'm energized by the progress we're making in enhancing the reasoning abilities of our AI models, and I can't wait to see what other breakthroughs emerge in this rapidly advancing field.\n</note>"
