Using MineDojo's data, we propose a novel agent learning\\nalgorithm that leverages large pre-trained video-language models as a learned\\nreward function.

MineDojo features:\n\n1. A benchmarking suite with thousands of diverse open-ended tasks in Minecraft, including both programmatic tasks with clear success criteria and creative tasks without straightforward evaluation.\n\n2. An internet-scale, multimodal knowledge base of Minecraft-related YouTube videos, Wiki pages, and Reddit discussions, capturing the collective experience and wisdom of millions of players.\n\n3. A novel agent learning algorithm that leverages this internet-scale data. The key innovation is MineCLIP, a contrastive video-language model trained on the YouTube videos, which can be used as an effective open-vocabulary reward function for reinforcement learning.\n\nThe authors show that agents trained with MineCLIP can solve a variety of complex tasks, often matching or outperforming agents trained with manually engineered dense rewards. For creative tasks without clear success criteria, MineCLIP also serves as an automatic evaluation metric that agrees well with human judgments.\n\nThe paper highlights the importance of open-ended environments, large-scale knowledge bases, and flexible agent architectures for developing generally capable embodied AI systems. The MineDojo framework and resources are open-sourced to promote further research in this direction.\n\nKeywords: open-ended environments, internet-scale knowledge, video-language models, reinforcement learning\n\nExample Questions:\n\nQ: How does the performance of the MineCLIP-based agent compare to agents trained with manually engineered dense rewards on the programmatic tasks in MineDojo?\nA: The MineCLIP-based agent achieves competitive performance compared to agents trained with manually engineered dense rewards, and in some cases even outperforms them, with up to 73% improvement in success rates.\n\nQ: How does the MineCLIP model serve as an automatic evaluation metric for the creative tasks in MineDojo that lack clear success criteria?\nA: The authors show that the MineCLIP model's output correlates well with human judgments on a subset of the creative tasks, achieving F1 scores above 95% in some cases. This allows MineCLIP to be used as an effective automatic evaluation metric for these open-ended tasks.\n\nQ: How does the internet-scale, multimodal knowledge base of Minecraft data collected in MineDojo enable new research directions for embodied AI agents?\nA: The diverse data sources, including YouTube videos, Wiki pages, and Reddit discussions, provide a rich source of Minecraft-related knowledge that agents can leverage. The authors suggest this data could be used to train large language models, extract hierarchical planning knowledge, and generate instructional text, opening up new possibilities for developing generally capable agents.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<note>\nIt's been an exciting day at work as we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with embodied AI agents. This morning, I spent some time diving deeper into the MineDojo framework, which is quickly becoming a game-changer in our field.\n\nThe idea of building agents that can truly generalize across a wide range of open-ended tasks is incredibly compelling. Instead of training our models in isolated environments with limited objectives, MineDojo provides a rich, Minecraft-based simulation suite that mirrors the complexity and diversity of the real world. And the addition of an internet-scale knowledge base, complete with videos, tutorials, and forum discussions, takes things to a whole new level.\n\nOne of the aspects I find most fascinating is the MineCLIP model, which uses contrastive learning to extract meaningful representations from all that Minecraft-related data. The fact that it can serve as an effective open-vocabulary reward function for reinforcement learning is just brilliant. It's like giving our agents a built-in intuition for what \"good\" looks like, without having to manually define it.\n\nI spent some time experimenting with the MineCLIP-based agent, and the results are really impressive. It's able to tackle a wide variety of tasks, from the more programmatic ones to the more open-ended, creative challenges. And the fact that it can match or even outperform agents trained with manually engineered rewards is a testament to the power of this approach.\n\nAs I was working, I couldn't help but think about the broader implications of this kind of technology. Imagine what we could do if we could build agents that can truly learn and adapt in the open world, drawing upon a vast wealth of knowledge and experience. The possibilities are endless â€“ from personal AI assistants that can handle any task we throw at them, to autonomous systems that can navigate complex real-world environments with ease.\n\nOf course, there's still a lot of work to be done. But with resources like MineDojo paving the way, I'm more excited than ever about the future of embodied AI. It's going to be a wild ride, and I can't wait to see what we'll be able to accomplish next.\n\n</note>"
