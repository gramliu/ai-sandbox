The key idea is to provide the model with a few exemplars that demonstrate a step-by-step \"chain of thought\" leading to the final answer, in addition to just the input-output pairs.\n\nThe main findings are:\n\n- Chain-of-thought prompting is an emergent ability that only appears in very large language models (>100B parameters). Smaller models fail to generate coherent chains of thought.\n\n- On arithmetic reasoning tasks like math word problems, chain-of-thought prompting enables models to outperform even finetuned, task-specific models, sometimes by a large margin. For example, PaLM 540B with chain-of-thought prompting achieves new state-of-the-art on the GSM8K benchmark.\n\n- Chain-of-thought prompting also improves performance on commonsense reasoning and symbolic manipulation tasks, by allowing the model to break down the problem into interpretable intermediate steps.\n\n- The generated chains of thought are not always factually correct, but they are generally coherent and can be used to arrive at the right answer. Improving the factuality of these chains of thought is an important direction for future work.\n\nKeywords: large language models, reasoning, prompting, chain of thought, arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic manipulation\n\nExample Questions:\n\nQ: How does the performance of phi-3-mini compare to state-of-the-art large language models when evaluated on standard academic NLP benchmarks?\nA: Phi-3-mini achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks, despite having only 3.8B parameters. This demonstrates the power of carefully curated training data to enable high quality in compact models.\n\nQ: What techniques were used to ensure phi-3-mini behaves in a safe, robust, and responsible manner during open-ended interactions with humans?\nA: The phi-3-mini model underwent an iterative process of safety alignment via finetuning on helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets, red-teaming to identify potential issues, and extensive automated testing across dozens of responsibility and safety harm categories. However, challenges still remain in fully solving safety issues with language models.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<note>\nToday was an interesting day at work. I spent a good chunk of the morning working on a project that involves building a more intuitive and interactive user interface for our content management system. The goal is to leverage natural language processing to allow users to issue commands and queries in plain English, rather than having to navigate a complex menu system.\n\nOne of the key challenges we're facing is ensuring that the language model we're using can actually understand the user's intent and break down the problem into a series of logical steps. I remember reading a paper a while back that explored this idea of \"chain-of-thought prompting\" - where you provide the model with some examples of how to reason through a problem step-by-step. Apparently, this can really boost the model's ability to tackle complex, multi-step tasks.\n\nWe've been experimenting with this approach, and the results have been quite promising. Even our largest language models seem to struggle with certain types of reasoning, like symbolic manipulation or commonsense inference. But when we give them a few demonstrations of how to break down the problem, they're able to generate their own coherent chains of thought and arrive at the right answer more consistently.\n\nIt's fascinating to see how these models can adapt and improve their reasoning abilities just by observing a few examples. Of course, the chains of thought they generate aren't always perfect - there's still room for improvement in terms of factual accuracy and robustness. But it's a step in the right direction, and I'm excited to see how this technology continues to evolve.\n\nIn the afternoon, I had a meeting with the team to discuss our roadmap for the next few quarters. We're really focused on making our content management platform as user-friendly and intelligent as possible. I think the work we're doing with natural language processing is going to be a key part of that. It's going to be interesting to see how our customers respond to these new capabilities.\n\nOverall, it's been a productive day. I'm always energized by the prospect of pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI and language technology. There's still so much to explore and discover, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.\n</note>"
