In particular, we show how such reasoning\\nabilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple\\nmethod called chain of thought prompting, where a few chain of thought\\ndemonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three\\nlarge language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance\\non a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The\\nempirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter\\nlanguage model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the\\nart accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even\\nfinetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.\\n\",\n  \"published\": \"2022-01-28T02:33:07Z\"\n}\n</metadata>\n<text>\nSummary:\n\nThis paper introduces phi-3-mini, a compact 3.8 billion parameter language model that achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks and internal testing, while being small enough to run locally on a modern smartphone. The key innovation is in the training data, which consists of heavily filtered web data and synthetic data, similar to the approach used for phi-2. The model is also aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format. Initial scaling results with 7B and 14B parameter models (phi-3-small and phi-3-medium) show significant further performance gains.\n\nDespite its small size, phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench. The model's main limitation is factual knowledge due to capacity constraints, but this can be mitigated by augmenting it with a search engine. Safety and responsibility were key focuses, with the model undergoing safety alignment, red-teaming, and automated testing. However, challenges remain around factual inaccuracies, bias, inappropriate content, and safety issues that still need to be fully addressed.\n\nKeywords: compact language models, filtered training data, on-device inference, model scaling, responsible AI\n\nExample Questions:\n\nQ: How does the performance of phi-3-mini compare to state-of-the-art large language models when evaluated on standard academic NLP benchmarks?\nA: Phi-3-mini achieves performance rivaling much larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 on academic benchmarks, achieving 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench despite having only 3.8B parameters. This demonstrates the power of carefully curated training data to enable high quality in compact models.\n\nQ: What techniques were used to ensure phi-3-mini behaves in a safe, robust, and responsible manner during open-ended interactions with humans?\nA: The phi-3-mini model underwent an iterative process of safety alignment via finetuning on helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets, red-teaming to identify potential issues, and extensive automated testing across dozens of responsibility and safety harm categories. However, challenges still remain in fully solving safety issues with language models that will require further research and development.\n\nQ: What are some potential beneficial applications of a model like phi-3-mini that can perform advanced language tasks while preserving user privacy by running fully on-device?\nA: Some potential applications include: 1) Privacy-preserving mobile AI assistants that can engage in open-ended dialogue and help with tasks like writing and analysis without sending user data to the cloud. 2) Embedded NLP systems for domains like healthcare where privacy is critical. 3) Democratization of advanced language AI capabilities to developers/researchers without access to massive computing resources.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "Unfortunately, the reference you provided does not appear to be about a model called \"phi-3-mini\". The paper is actually about \"Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models\". It does not mention a compact 3.8 billion parameter language model. I cannot generate a realistic journal entry based on this information. Please provide a reference that is more relevant to the topic you would like me to write about."
