Key findings:\n\n- Providing multimodal models with many demonstrating examples (up to ~2,000) leads to substantial performance improvements compared to few-shot (<100 examples) ICL across 10 datasets spanning multiple domains and tasks.\n\n- Gemini 1.5 Pro generally exhibits log-linear performance improvements as the number of demonstrating examples increases, while GPT-4o shows less stable improvements.\n\n- Gemini 1.5 Pro demonstrates higher ICL data efficiency than GPT-4o on most datasets, meaning it learns more from each additional demonstrating example.\n\n- Batching multiple queries in a single request can achieve similar or better performance than single query requests in a many-shot setting, while drastically reducing per-query latency and cost.\n\n- Batching queries can also lead to substantial performance improvements in the zero-shot setting, due to benefits from domain calibration, class calibration, and self-generated demonstrations.\n\nKeywords: multimodal foundation models, in-context learning, many-shot learning, batch querying, data efficiency\n\nExample Questions:\n1. How does the performance of Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o compare when scaling the number of demonstrating examples from few-shot to many-shot in-context learning?\n2. What techniques were used to ensure the safety and responsibility of the multimodal models during open-ended interactions?\n3. How could the ability to run highly capable multimodal models like phi-3-mini directly on consumer devices change the development and deployment of AI assistants in the future?\n4. What are some potential beneficial applications of a model like phi-3-mini that can perform advanced language tasks while preserving user privacy by running fully on-device?\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<note>\nToday was an exciting day as I dove deeper into the research on many-shot in-context learning (ICL) with multimodal foundation models. The paper on GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro really caught my attention, as it highlights the potential of these advanced models to adapt to new tasks and domains through the use of large numbers of demonstrating examples.\n\nI spent the morning setting up the WebArena environment we've been working with and integrating the benchmark tasks from the paper. It's fascinating to see how these multimodal models can perform on a wide range of tasks, from natural imagery classification to remote sensing and molecular analysis. The ability to provide the models with up to 2,000 demonstrating examples is a game-changer, as it allows them to learn much more effectively than the traditional few-shot ICL approach.\n\nDuring our team meeting, we discussed the implications of the paper's findings. The fact that Gemini 1.5 Pro exhibits log-linear performance improvements as the number of demonstrations increases is particularly exciting. This suggests that with the right training and fine-tuning, we could potentially create highly capable and adaptable agents that can tackle complex, real-world tasks on the web.\n\nOne area we're especially interested in is the impact of batching multiple queries in a single request. The paper shows that this can lead to substantial performance improvements, especially in the zero-shot setting, while also reducing latency and cost. This could be a crucial optimization for our privacy-preserving mobile AI assistant, as we strive to deliver high-quality results without compromising on-device resources.\n\nIn the afternoon, I spent some time analyzing the data efficiency metrics reported in the paper. The finding that Gemini 1.5 Pro learns more from each additional demonstrating example compared to GPT-4o is really intriguing. This could have significant implications for how we design our training pipelines and fine-tuning strategies, as we aim to maximize the impact of the limited data we have access to.\n\nAs I wrapped up my work for the day, I couldn't help but feel excited about the potential of these multimodal foundation models. The ability to adapt them to new tasks and domains through many-shot ICL could truly revolutionize the way we build intelligent agents. I'm looking forward to experimenting with these techniques and seeing how we can push the boundaries of what's possible.\n\n</note>"
