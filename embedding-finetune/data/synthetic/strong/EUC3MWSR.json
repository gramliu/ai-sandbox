  "output": "<note>\nToday was an exciting day as I delved deeper into the research on multi-token prediction for large language models. The paper on \"Better & Faster Large Language Models via Multi-token Prediction\" has really got me thinking about the potential of this approach.\n\nThe key finding that training models to predict multiple future tokens at once can lead to higher sample efficiency and improved downstream capabilities is fascinating. I spent the morning running some experiments on our current GPT-4 based agent, comparing its performance on coding benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP to models trained with the multi-token prediction approach.\n\nThe results were quite impressive - our multi-token prediction model was able to solve 12% more problems on HumanEval and 17% more on MBPP compared to the standard next-token model. This really highlights the benefits of this training strategy, especially for generative tasks like coding.\n\nI also explored the impact of multi-token prediction on the model's ability to learn induction and algorithmic reasoning capabilities. The paper suggests that this approach is particularly helpful for smaller model sizes, which is relevant for our work on embedded NLP systems for privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare.\n\nOne aspect I'm really excited about is the potential for faster inference speeds with multi-token prediction models. The paper mentions they can be up to 3 times faster, even with large batch sizes. This could be a game-changer for our mobile AI assistant project, where low-latency is crucial.\n\nAfter lunch, I had a call with the team to discuss how we can incorporate these findings into our roadmap. We brainstormed ideas for enhancing our current agents with multi-token prediction, as well as exploring ways to leverage the improved reasoning capabilities for more complex, real-world tasks.\n\nI'm really looking forward to diving deeper into this research and seeing how we can push the boundaries of what our language models can achieve. The ability to run highly capable models like this directly on consumer devices could truly revolutionize the development and deployment of AI assistants in the future.\n\nAs for the rest of the day, I managed to squeeze in a quick workout before heading home. It's been a mentally stimulating day, and I'm eager to continue exploring these exciting advancements in large language models.\n</note>"
