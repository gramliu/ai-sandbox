MineDojo features:\n\n1. A benchmarking suite with thousands of diverse open-ended tasks in Minecraft, including both programmatic tasks with clear success criteria and creative tasks without straightforward evaluation.\n\n2. An internet-scale, multimodal knowledge base of Minecraft-related YouTube videos, Wiki pages, and Reddit discussions, capturing the collective experience and wisdom of millions of players.\n\n3. A novel agent learning algorithm that leverages this internet-scale data. The key innovation is MineCLIP, a contrastive video-language model trained on the YouTube videos, which can be used as an effective open-vocabulary reward function for reinforcement learning.\n\nThe authors show that agents trained with MineCLIP can solve a variety of complex tasks, often matching or outperforming agents trained with manually engineered dense rewards. For creative tasks without clear success criteria, MineCLIP also serves as an automatic evaluation metric that agrees well with human judgments.\n\nThe paper highlights the importance of open-ended environments, large-scale knowledge bases, and flexible agent architectures for developing generally capable embodied AI systems. The MineDojo framework and resources are open-sourced to promote further research in this direction.\n\nKeywords: open-ended environments, internet-scale knowledge, video-language models, reinforcement learning\n\nExample Questions:\n\nQ: How does the performance of the MineCLIP-based agent compare to agents trained with manually engineered dense rewards on the programmatic tasks in MineDojo?\nA: The MineCLIP-based agent achieves competitive performance compared to agents trained with manually engineered dense rewards, and in some cases even outperforms them, with up to 73% improvement in success rates.\n\nQ: How does the MineCLIP model serve as an automatic evaluation metric for the creative tasks in MineDojo that lack clear success criteria?\nA: The authors show that the MineCLIP model's output correlates well with human judgments on a subset of the creative tasks, achieving F1 scores above 95% in some cases. This allows MineCLIP to be used as an effective automatic evaluation metric for these open-ended tasks.\n\nQ: How does the internet-scale, multimodal knowledge base of Minecraft data collected in MineDojo enable new research directions for embodied AI agents?\nA: The diverse data sources, including YouTube videos, Wiki pages, and Reddit discussions, provide a rich source of Minecraft-related knowledge that agents can leverage. The authors suggest this data could be used to train large language models, extract hierarchical planning knowledge, and generate instructional text, opening up new possibilities for developing generally capable agents.\n</text>\n</reference>",
  "output": "<note>\nToday was an exciting day as I delved deeper into the MineDojo framework, a new platform for developing generally capable embodied AI agents. The key idea behind MineDojo is to provide a rich, open-ended environment coupled with an internet-scale knowledge base to enable agents to learn and adapt in a more human-like way.\n\nI spent the morning reviewing the details of the MineDojo environment, which is built on the popular Minecraft game. The simulation suite includes thousands of diverse tasks, ranging from programmatic challenges with clear success criteria to more open-ended, creative scenarios. This diversity is crucial for training agents that can generalize beyond narrow, specialized domains.\n\nWhat really caught my attention was the internet-scale knowledge base that MineDojo provides, which includes a wealth of Minecraft-related content from YouTube videos, Wiki pages, and online forums. This data captures the collective experience and wisdom of millions of players, and I can see how it could be leveraged to enhance the agents' capabilities.\n\nOne of the key innovations in MineDojo is the MineCLIP model, a contrastive video-language model trained on the YouTube videos. The authors show that this model can be used as an effective open-vocabulary reward function for reinforcement learning, allowing agents to solve complex tasks without the need for manually engineered dense rewards.\n\nIn the afternoon, I started experimenting with the MineCLIP-based agent in the MineDojo environment. I was impressed by its ability to tackle a variety of tasks, often matching or even outperforming agents trained with traditional reward shaping. The agent's performance was particularly notable on the more open-ended, creative tasks, where MineCLIP served as an automatic evaluation metric that aligned well with human judgments.\n\nThis research really highlights the importance of moving beyond isolated, specialized environments and towards more open-ended, knowledge-rich setups for developing generally capable embodied AI systems. The MineDojo framework provides a strong foundation for this, and I'm excited to explore how we can further leverage its capabilities in our own projects.\n\nAs I wrapped up the day, I couldn't help but feel inspired by the potential of this work. Imagine the possibilities if we could create agents that can continually learn and adapt, just like humans, by drawing upon a vast wealth of internet-scale knowledge. It's a lofty goal, but the MineDojo team has taken an important step in that direction. I can't wait to see what the future holds!\n\n</note>"
