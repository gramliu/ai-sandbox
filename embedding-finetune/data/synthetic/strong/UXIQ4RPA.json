To overcome this issue, most existing works focus on\\nretrieving the relevant context from the document, representing them as plain\\ntext. However, documents such as PDFs, web pages, and presentations are\\nnaturally structured with different pages, tables, sections, and so on.\\nRepresenting such structured documents as plain text is incongruous with the\\nuser's mental model of these documents with rich structure. When a system has\\nto query the document for context, this incongruity is brought to the fore, and\\nseemingly trivial questions can trip up the QA system. To bridge this\\nfundamental gap in handling structured documents, we propose an approach called\\nPDFTriage that enables models to retrieve the context based on either structure\\nor content. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\\nPDFTriage-augmented models across several classes of questions where existing\\nretrieval-augmented LLMs fail. To facilitate further research on this\\nfundamental problem, we release our benchmark dataset consisting of 900+\\nhuman-generated questions over 80 structured documents from 10 different\\ncategories of question types for document QA.

  "output": "<note>\nToday was an exciting day as I dove deeper into the research around PDFTriage, a novel approach for question answering over long, structured documents. As a software engineer working on AI-powered document processing, this paper really resonated with the challenges we've been facing in our projects.\n\nThe key insight from the paper is that current language models struggle with document QA tasks because they treat structured documents like PDFs and web pages as plain text, ignoring the rich metadata and layout information that is crucial for understanding the content. This incongruity between the model's representation and the user's mental model of the document can lead to failures on seemingly trivial questions.\n\nAfter reading through the paper, I spent the morning setting up the PDFTriage benchmark dataset that the authors released. It's a great resource, with over 900 human-generated questions across 80 structured documents from 10 different categories. I'm eager to use this dataset to evaluate our current document QA models and identify areas for improvement.\n\nIn the team meeting, we discussed how we could integrate the PDFTriage approach into our existing pipeline. The key idea is to leverage the document structure metadata, such as pages, sections, and tables, to better retrieve the relevant context for answering questions. This goes beyond just treating the document as plain text, which is a limitation of many retrieval-augmented language models.\n\nI spent the afternoon prototyping a PDFTriage-inspired module for our document QA system. The initial results were promising - our model was able to handle questions that required understanding the structure of the document, such as summarizing the key points from specific pages or locating information in a table. This is a significant improvement over our previous plain-text-based approach.\n\nOne challenge I encountered was how to effectively combine the structural and content-based retrieval signals to optimize the overall QA performance. I'll need to experiment further with different weighting schemes and fusion techniques to find the right balance.\n\nOn a personal note, I'm really excited about the potential of PDFTriage and similar approaches to bridge the gap between language models and the way humans naturally interact with structured documents. It's a fundamental problem that has far-reaching implications for a wide range of document-centric applications. I can't wait to see how this field evolves and how we can contribute to the progress.\n\n</note>"
